<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">At</span> the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, held at Oxford in 1860, I read an abstract
of the physiological argument contained in this work
respecting the mental progress of Europe, reserving the
historical evidence for subsequent publication.</p>

<p>This work contains that evidence. It is intended as the
completion of my treatise on Human Physiology, in which
man was considered as an individual. In this he is
considered in his social relation.</p>

<p>But the reader will also find, I think, that it is a
history of the progress of ideas and opinions from a point
of view heretofore almost entirely neglected. There are
two methods of dealing with philosophical questions&mdash;the
literary and the scientific. Many things which in a
purely literary treatment of the subject remain in the
background, spontaneously assume a more striking position
when their scientific relations are considered. It is the
latter method that I have used.</p>

<p>Social advancement is as completely under the control of
natural law as is bodily growth. The life of an individual
is a miniature of the life of a nation. These propositions
it is the special object of this book to demonstrate.</p>

<p>No one, I believe, has hitherto undertaken the labour of
arranging the evidence offered by the intellectual history
of Europe in accordance with physiological principles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
so as to illustrate the orderly progress of civilization,
or collected the facts furnished by other branches of
science with a view of enabling us to recognize clearly
the conditions under which that progress takes place.
This philosophical deficiency I have endeavoured in the
following pages to supply.</p>

<p>Seen thus through the medium of physiology, history
presents a new aspect to us. We gain a more just and
thorough appreciation of the thoughts and motives of men
in successive ages of the world.</p>

<p>In the Preface to the second edition of my Physiology,
published in 1858, it was mentioned that this work was
at that time written. The changes that have been since
made in it have been chiefly with a view of condensing it.
The discussion of several scientific questions, such as that
of the origin of species, which have recently attracted
public attention so strongly, has, however remained untouched,
the principles offered being the same as presented
in the former work in 1856.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> reprints of this work having been issued, and
translations published in various foreign languages,
French, German, Russian, Polish, Servian, &amp;c., I have
been induced to revise it carefully, and to make additions
wherever they seemed to be desirable. I therefore hope
that it will commend itself to the continued approval
of the public.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The subject proposed.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I intend</span>, in this work, to consider in what manner the
advancement of Europe in civilization has taken
place, to ascertain how far its progress has been
fortuitous, and how far determined by primordial law.</p>

<p>Does the procession of nations in time, like the erratic
phantasm of a dream, go forward without reason or order?
or, is there a predetermined, a solemn march, in which
all must join, ever moving, ever resistlessly advancing,
encountering and enduring an inevitable succession of
events?</p>

<p>In a philosophical examination of the intellectual and
political history of nations, an answer to these questions
is to be found. But how difficult it is to master the mass
of facts necessary to be collected, to handle so great an
accumulation, to place it in the clearest point of view;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
how difficult it is to select correctly the representative
<span class="sidenote">Its difficulty and grandeur.</span>
men, to produce them in the proper scenes, and
to conduct successfully so grand and complicated
a drama as that of European life! Though in
one sense the subject offers itself as a scientific problem,
and in that manner alone I have to deal with it; in
another it swells into a noble epic&mdash;the life of humanity,
its warfare and repose, its object and its end.</p>

<p>Man is the archetype of society. Individual development
is the model of social progress.</p>

<p>Some have asserted that human affairs are altogether
determined by the voluntary action of men, some that the
Providence of God directs us in every step, some that all
events are fixed by Destiny. It is for us to ascertain how
far each of these affirmations is true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Individual life of a mixed kind.</div>

<p>The life of individual man is of a mixed nature. In
part he submits to the free-will impulses of
himself and others, in part he is under the
inexorable dominion of law. He insensibly
changes his estimate of the relative power of each of these
influences as he passes through successive stages. In the
confidence of youth he imagines that very much is under
his control, in the disappointment of old age very little.
As time wears on, and the delusions of early imagination
vanish away, he learns to correct his sanguine views, and
prescribes a narrower boundary for the things he expects
to obtain. The realities of life undeceive him at last, and
there steals over the evening of his days an unwelcome
conviction of the vanity of human hopes. The things he
has secured are not the things he expected. He sees that
a Supreme Power has been using him for unknown ends,
that he was brought into the world without his own
knowledge, and is departing from it against his own will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It foreshadows social life.</div>

<p>Whoever has made the physical and intellectual history
of individual man his study, will be prepared to admit in
what a surprising manner it foreshadows social
history. The equilibrium and movement of
humanity are altogether physiological phenomena.
Yet not without hesitation may such an opinion be
frankly avowed, since it is offensive to the pride, and to
many of the prejudices and interests of our age. An author
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
who has been disposed to devote many years to the labour
of illustrating this topic, has need of the earnest support
of all who prize the truth; and, considering the extent
and profundity of his subject, his work, at the best, must
be very imperfect, requiring all the forbearance, and even
the generosity of criticism.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">First opinions of savage life.</span>
In the intellectual infancy of a savage state, Man
transfers to Nature his conceptions of himself,
and, considering that every thing he does is
determined by his own pleasure, regards all passing
events as depending on the arbitrary volition of a superior
but invisible power. He gives to the world a constitution
like his own. His tendency is necessarily to superstition.
Whatever is strange, or powerful, or vast, impresses
his imagination with dread. Such objects are only
the outward manifestations of an indwelling spirit, and
therefore worthy of his veneration.</p>

<p>After Reason, aided by Experience, has led him forth
from these delusions as respects surrounding things, he
still clings to his original ideas as respects objects far
removed. In the distance and irresistible motions of the
stars he finds arguments for the supernatural, and gives
to each of those shining bodies an abiding and controlling
genius. The mental phase through which he is passing
permits him to believe in the exercise of planetary
influences on himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fetichism displaced by star-worship.</div>

<p>But as reason led him forth from fetichism, so in due
time it again leads him forth from star-worship.
Perhaps not without regret does he abandon the
mythological forms he has created; for, long
after he has ascertained that the planets are nothing more
than shining points, without any perceptible influence on
him, he still venerates the genii once supposed to vivify
them, perhaps even he exalts them into immortal gods.</p>

<p>Philosophically speaking, he is exchanging by ascending
degrees his primitive doctrine of arbitrary volition for the
doctrine of law. As the fall of a stone, the flowing of a
river, the movement of a shadow, the rustling of a leaf,
have been traced to physical causes, to like causes at last
are traced the revolutions of the stars. In events and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
scenes continually increasing in greatness and grandeur,
<span class="sidenote">The idea of government by law.</span>
he is detecting the dominion of law. The goblins, and
genii, and gods who successively extorted his
fear and veneration, who determined events by
their fitful passions or whims, are at last displaced
by the noble conception of one Almighty Being,
who rules the universe according to reason, and therefore
according to law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its application to the solar system.</div>

<p>In this manner the doctrine of government by law is
extended, until at last it embraces all natural events. It
was thus that, hardly two centuries ago, that doctrine
gathered immense force from the discovery of Newton that
Kepler's laws, under which the movements of the
planetary bodies are executed, issue as a mathematical
necessity from a very simple material
condition, and that the complicated motions of the solar
system cannot be other than they are. Few of those who
read in the beautiful geometry of the 'Principia' the demonstration
of this fact, saw the imposing philosophical consequences
which must inevitably follow this scientific
discovery. And now the investigation of the aspect of
the skies in past ages, and all predictions of its future,
rest essentially upon the principle that no arbitrary volition
ever intervenes, the gigantic mechanism moving
impassively in accordance with a mathematical law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And to terrestrial events.</div>

<p>And so upon the earth, the more perfectly we understand
the causes of present events, the more plainly are they
seen to be the consequences of physical conditions, and
therefore the results of law. To allude to one
example out of many that might be considered,
the winds, how proverbially inconstant, who can tell
whence they come or whither they go! If any thing
bears the fitful character of arbitrary volition, surely it is
these. But we deceive ourselves in imagining that atmospheric
events are fortuitous. Where shall a line be
drawn between that eternal trade-wind, which, originating
in well-understood physical causes, sweeps, like the breath
of Destiny, slowly, and solemnly, and everlastingly over
the Pacific Ocean, and the variable gusts into which it
degenerates in more northerly and southerly regions&mdash;gusts
which seem to come without any cause, and to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
away without leaving any trace? In what latitude is it
that the domain of the physical ends, and that of the
supernatural begins?</p>

<p>All mundane events are the results of the operation of
law. Every movement in the skies or upon the earth
proclaims to us that the universe is under government.</p>

<p>But if we admit that this is the case, from the mote
that floats in the sunbeam to multiple stars revolving
round each other, are we willing to carry our principles to
their consequences, and recognise a like operation of law
among living as among lifeless things, in the organic as
well as the inorganic world? What testimony does
physiology offer on this point?</p>

<div class="sidenote">And to the organic world.</div>

<p>Physiology, in its progress, has passed through the same
phases as physics. Living beings have been considered
as beyond the power of external influences, and, conspicuously
among them, Man has been affirmed
to be independent of the forces that rule the
world in which he lives. Besides that immaterial principle,
the soul, which distinguishes him from all his
animated companions, and makes him a moral and responsible
being, he has been feigned, like them, to possess
another immaterial principle, the vital agent, which, in a
way of its own, carries forward all the various operations
in his economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Especially to man.</div>

<p>But when it was discovered that the heart of man is
constructed upon the recognised rules of hydraulics, and
with its great tubes is furnished with common mechanical
contrivances, valves; when it was discovered
that the eye has been arranged on the most refined
principles of optics, its cornea, and humours, and
lens properly converging the rays to form an image&mdash;its
iris, like the diaphragm of a telescope or microscope, shutting
out stray light, and also regulating the quantity
admitted; when it was discovered that the ear is furnished
with the means of dealing with the three characteristics
of sound&mdash;its tympanum for intensity, its cochlea for
pitch, its semicircular canals for quality; when it was
seen that the air brought into the great air-passages by
the descent of the diaphragm, calling into play atmospheric
pressure, is conveyed upon physical principles into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the ultimate cells of the lungs, and thence into the blood,
producing chemical changes throughout the system, disengaging
heat, and permitting all the functions of organic
life to go on; when these facts and very many others of
a like kind were brought into prominence by modern
physiology, it obviously became necessary to admit that
animated beings do not constitute the exception once
supposed, and that organic operations are the result of
physical agencies.</p>

<p>If thus, in the recesses of the individual economy, these
natural agents bear sway, must they not operate in the
social economy too?</p>

<div class="sidenote">In social as well as individual life.</div>

<p>Has the great shadeless desert nothing to do with the
habits of the nomade tribes who pitch their tents
upon it&mdash;the fertile plain no connection with
flocks and pastoral life&mdash;the mountain fastnesses
with the courage that has so often defended them&mdash;the sea
with habits of adventure? Indeed, do not all our expectations
of the stability of social institutions rest upon our
belief in the stability of surrounding physical conditions?
From the time of Bodin, who nearly three hundred years
ago published his work 'De Republica,' these principles
have been well recognized: that the laws of Nature cannot
be subordinated to the will of Man, and that government
must be adapted to climate. It was these things which
led him to the conclusion that force is best resorted to for
northern nations, reason for the middle, and superstition
for the southern.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the seasons on animals and plants.</div>

<p>In the month of March the sun crosses the equator,
dispensing his rays more abundantly over our northern
hemisphere. Following in his train, a wave of verdure
expands towards the pole. The luxuriance is in
proportion to the local brilliancy. The animal
world is also affected. Pressed forward, or
solicited onward by the warmth, the birds of
passage commence their annual migration, keeping pace
with the developing vegetation beneath. As summer
declines, this orderly advance of light and life is followed
by an orderly retreat, and in its turn the southern hemisphere
presents the same glorious phenomenon. Once
every year the life of the earth pulsates; now there is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
abounding vitality, now a desolation. But what is the
cause of all this? It is only mechanical. The earth's
axis of rotation is inclined to the plane of her orbit of
revolution round the sun.</p>

<p>Let that wonderful phenomenon and its explanation be
a lesson to us; let it profoundly impress us with the
importance of physical agents and physical laws. They
intervene in the life and death of man personally and
socially. External events become interwoven in our
constitution; their periodicities create periodicities in us.
Day and night are incorporated in our waking and
sleeping; summer and winter compel us to exhibit cycles
in our life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Individual existence depends on physical conditions.</div>

<p>They who have paid attention to the subject have long
ago ascertained that the possibility of human
existence on the earth depends on conditions
altogether of a material kind. Since it is only
within a narrow range of temperature that life
can be maintained, it is needful that our planet should be
at a definite mean distance from the source of light and
heat, the sun; and that the form of her orbit should be
so little eccentric as to approach closely to a circle. If
her mass were larger or less than it is, the weight of all
living and lifeless things on her surface would no longer
be the same; but absolute weight is one of the primary
elements of organic construction. A change in the time
of her diurnal rotation, as affecting the length of the day
and night, must at once be followed by a corresponding
modification of the periodicities of the nervous system of
animals; a change in her orbitual translation round the
sun, as determining the duration of the year, would, in like
manner, give rise to a marked effect. If the year were
shorter, we should live faster and die sooner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animal and vegetable life interbalanced by material
conditions.</div>

<p>In the present economy of our globe, natural agents are
relied upon as the means of regulation and of
government. Through heat, the distribution
and arrangement of the vegetable tribes are
accomplished; through their mutual relations
with the atmospheric air, plants and animals are interbalanced,
and neither permitted to obtain a superiority.
Considering the magnitude of this condition, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
necessity to general life, it might seem worthy of incessant
Divine intervention, yet it is in fact accomplished
automatically.</p>

<p>Of past organic history the same remark may be made.
The condensation of carbon from the air, and its inclusion
in the strata, constitute the chief epoch in the organic
<span class="sidenote">And also appearances and extinctions determined.</span>
life of the earth, giving a possibility for the
appearance of the hot-blooded and more intellectual
animal tribes. That great event was
occasioned by the influence of the rays of the
sun. And as such influences have thus been connected
with the appearance of organisms, so likewise have they
been concerned in the removal. Of the myriads of species
which have become extinct, doubtless every one has passed
away through the advent of material conditions incompatible
with its continuance. Even now, a fall of half-a-dozen
degrees in the mean temperature of any latitude
would occasion the vanishing of the forms of warmer
climates, and the advent of those of the colder. An
obscuration of the rays of the sun for a few years would
compel a redistribution of plants and animals all over the
earth; many would totally disappear, and everywhere
new comers would be seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permanence
of organisms
due to immobility
of external
conditions.</div>

<p>The permanence of organic forms is altogether dependent
on the invariability of the material conditions
under which they live. Any variation therein,
no matter how insignificant it might be, would
be forthwith followed by a corresponding variation
in the form. The present invariability
of the world of organization is the direct consequence of
the physical equilibrium, and so it will continue as long
as the mean temperature, the annual supply of light, the
composition of the air, the distribution of water, oceanic
and atmospheric currents, and other such agencies remain
unaltered; but if any one of these, or of a hundred other
incidents that might be mentioned, should suffer modification,
in an instant the fanciful doctrine of the immutability
of species would be brought to its true value.
The organic world appears to be in repose, because natural
influences have reached an equilibrium. A marble may
remain for ever motionless upon a level table; but let the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
surface be a little inclined, and the marble will quickly
run off. What should we say of him, who, contemplating
it in its state of rest, asserted that it was impossible for it
ever to move?</p>

<p>They who can see no difference between the race-horse
and the Shetland pony, the bantam and the Shanghai fowl,
the greyhound and the poodle dog, who altogether deny
that impressions can be made on species, and see in the long
succession of extinct forms, the ancient existence of which
they must acknowledge, the evidences of a continuous and
<span class="sidenote">Orderly sequence of conditions is followed
by orderly organic changes.</span>
creative intervention, forget that mundane effects
observe definite sequences, event following event
in the necessity of the case, and thus constituting
a chain, each link of which hangs on a preceding,
and holds a succeeding one. Physical
influences thus following one another, and bearing to each
other the inter-relation of cause and effect, stand in their
totality to the whole organic world as causes, it representing
the effect, and the order of succession existing
among them is perpetuated or embodied in it. Thus, in
those ancient times to which we have referred, the sunlight
acting on the leaves of plants disturbed the chemical
constitution of the atmosphere, gave rise to the accumulation
of a more energetic element therein, diminished the
mechanical pressure, and changed the rate of evaporation
from the sea, a series of events following one another so
necessarily that we foresee their order, and, in their turn,
making an impression on the vegetable and animal
economy. The natural influences, thus varying in an
orderly way, controlled botanical events, and made them
change correspondingly. The orderly procedure of the
one must be imitated in the orderly procedure of the other.
And the same holds good in the animal kingdom; the
recognized variation in the material conditions is copied in
the organic effects, in vigour of motion, energy of life,
intellectual power.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we notice such orderly successions, we
must not at once assign them to a direct intervention, the
issue of wise predeterminations of a voluntary agent; we
must first satisfy ourselves how far they are dependent on
mundane or material conditions, occurring in a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and necessary series, ever bearing in mind the important
principle that an orderly sequence of inorganic events necessarily
involves an orderly and corresponding progression
of organic life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Universal
control of
physical
agents over
organisms.</div>

<p>To this doctrine of the control of physical agencies over
organic forms I acknowledge no exception, not
even in the case of man. The varied aspects he
presents in different countries are the necessary
consequences of those influences.</p>

<p>He who advocates the doctrine of the unity of the
human race is plainly forced to the admission of the
absolute control of such agents over the organization of
man, since the originally-created type has been brought to
exhibit very different aspects in different parts of the
world, apparently in accordance with the climate and other
purely material circumstances. To those circumstances it
is scarcely necessary to add manner of life, for that itself
<span class="sidenote">The case of man.</span>
arises from them. The doctrine of unity demands
as its essential postulate an admission of
the paramount control of physical agents over the human
aspect and organization, else how could it be that, proceeding
from the same stock, all shades of complexion in
the skin, and variety in the form of the skull, should have
arisen? Experience assures us that these are changes
assumed only by slow degrees, and not with abruptness;
they come as a cumulative effect. They plainly enforce
the doctrine that national type is not to be regarded as a
definite or final thing, a seeming immobility in this
particular being due to the attainment of a correspondence
with the conditions to which the type is exposed. Let
those conditions be changed, and it begins forthwith to
change too. I repeat it, therefore, that he who receives
the doctrine of the unity of the human race, must also
accept, in view of the present state of humanity on various
parts of the surface of our planet, its necessary postulate,
the complete control of physical agents, whether natural,
or arising artificially from the arts of civilization and the
secular progress of nations toward a correspondence with
the conditions to which they are exposed.</p>

<p>To the same conclusion also must he be brought who
advocates the origin of different races from different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
centres. It comes to the same thing, whichever of those
doctrines we adopt. Each brings us to the admission of
the transitory nature of typical forms, to their transmutations
and extinctions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human variations.</div>

<p>Variations in the aspect of men are best seen when an
examination is made of nations arranged in a northerly
and southerly direction; the result is such as
would ensue to an emigrant passing slowly along
a meridional track; but the case would be quite different
if the movement were along a parallel of latitude. In
this latter direction the variations of climate are far less
marked, and depend much more on geographical than on
astronomical causes. In emigrations of this kind there is
never that rapid change of aspect, complexion, and intellectual
power which must occur in the other. Thus,
though the mean temperature of Europe increases from
Poland to France, chiefly through the influence of the
great Atlantic current transferring heat from the Gulf of
Mexico and tropical ocean, that rise is far less than would
be encountered on passing through the same distance to
the south. By the arts of civilization man can much more
easily avoid the difficulties arising from variations along a
parallel of latitude than those upon a meridian, for the
simple reason that in that case those variations are less.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their political
result.</div>

<p>But it is not only complexion, development of the brain,
and, therefore, intellectual power, which are thus affected.
With difference of climate there must be differences of
manners and customs, that is, differences in the modes of
civilization. These are facts which deserve our
most serious attention, since such differences are
inevitably connected with political results. If homogeneousness
be an element of strength, an empire that lies
east and west must be more powerful than one that lies
north and south. I cannot but think that this was no
inconsiderable cause of the greatness and permanence of
Rome and that it lightened the task of the emperors, often
hard enough, in government. There is a natural tendency to
homogeneousness in the east and west direction, a tendency
to diversity and antagonism in the north and south, and
hence it is that government under the latter circumstances
will always demand the highest grade of statesmanship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of
transitional
forms.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The transitional forms which an animal type is capable
of producing on a passage north and south are much more
numerous than those it can produce on a passage east and
west. These, though they are truly transitional as
respects the type from which they have proceeded,
are permanent as regards the locality in
which they occur, being, in fact, the incarnation
of its physical influences. As long, therefore, as those influences
remain without change the form that has been
produced will last without any alteration. For such a
permanent form in the case of man we may adopt the
designation of an ethnical element.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions of
change in an
ethnical element.</div>

<p>An ethnical element is therefore necessarily of a dependent
nature; its durability arises from its
perfect correspondence with its environment.
Whatever can affect that correspondence will
touch its life.</p>

<p>Such considerations carry us from individual man to
groups of men or nations. There is a progress for races of
men as well marked as the progress of one man. There
<span class="sidenote">Progress of nations like
that of individuals.</span>
are thoughts and actions appertaining to specific
periods in the one case as in the other. Without
difficulty we affirm of a given act that it
appertains to a given period. We recognize the
noisy sports of boyhood, the business application of maturity,
the feeble garrulity of old age. We express our
surprise when we witness actions unsuitable to the epoch
of life. As it is in this respect in the individual, so it is
in the nation. The march of individual existence shadows
forth the march of race-existence, being, indeed, its
representative on a little scale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Communities,
like families,
exhibit members
in different
stages of
advance.</div>

<p>Groups of men, or nations, are disturbed by the same
accidents, or complete the same cycle as the individual.
Some scarcely pass beyond infancy, some are
destroyed on a sudden, some die of mere old
age. In this confusion of events, it might seem
altogether hopeless to disentangle the law which
is guiding them all, and demonstrate it clearly.
Of such groups, each may exhibit, at the same moment,
an advance to a different stage, just as we see in the same
family the young, the middle-aged, the old. It is thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that Europe shows in its different parts societies in very
different states&mdash;here the restless civilization of France
and England, there the contentment and inferiority of
Lapland. This commingling might seem to render it
difficult to ascertain the true movement of the whole
continent, and still more so for distant and successive
periods of time. In each nation, moreover, the contemporaneously
different classes, the educated and illiterate,
the idle and industrious, the rich and poor, the
intelligent and superstitious, represent different contemporaneous
stages of advancement. One may have
made a great progress, another scarcely have advanced at
all. How shall we ascertain the real state of the case?
Which of these classes shall we regard as the truest and
most perfect type?</p>

<p>Though difficult, this ascertainment is not impossible.
The problem is to be dealt with in the same manner that
we should estimate a family in which there are persons of
every condition from infancy to old age. Each member
of it tends to pursue a definite course, though some, cut off
in an untimely manner, may not complete it. One may be
enfeebled by accident, another by disease; but each, if
his past and present circumstances be fully considered,
will illustrate the nature of the general movement that
all are making. To demonstrate that movement most satisfactorily,
certain members of such a family suit our purpose
better than others, because they more closely represent
its type, or have advanced farthest in their career.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The intellectual
class the
true representative
of a
community.</div>

<p>So in a family of many nations, some are more mature,
some less advanced, some die in early life, some are worn
out by extreme old age; all show special peculiarities.
There are distinctions among kinsmen, whether
we consider them intellectually or corporeally.
Every one, nevertheless, illustrates in his own
degree the march that all are making, but some
do it more, some less completely. The leading, the intellectual
class, is hence always the true representative of
a state. It has passed step by step through the lower
stages, and has made the greatest advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interstitial
change and
death the condition
of individual
life.</div>

<p>In an individual, life is maintained only by the production
and destruction of organic particles, no portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the system being in a state of immobility, but each
displaying incessant change. Death is, therefore,
necessarily the condition of life, and the
more energetic the function of a part&mdash;or, if we
compare different animals with one another&mdash;the
more active the mode of existence, correspondingly,
the greater the waste and the more numerous the deaths
of the interstitial constituents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Particles in
the individual
answer to
persons in the
state.</div>

<p>To the death of particles in the individual answers the
death of persons in the nation, of which they
are the integral constituents. In both cases, in
a period of time quite inconsiderable, a total
change is accomplished without the entire system,
which is the sum of these separate parts, losing its identity.
Each particle or each person comes into existence,
discharges an appropriate duty, and then passes away,
perhaps unnoticed. The production, continuance, and
death of an organic molecule in the person answers to the
production, continuance, and death of a person in the
nation. Nutrition and decay in one case are equivalent to
well-being and transformation in the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Epochs in
national the
same as in individual
life.</div>

<p>In the same manner that the individual is liable to
changes through the action of external agencies,
and offers no resistance thereto, nor any indication
of the possession of a physiological inertia,
but submits at once to any impression, so likewise
it is with aggregates of men constituting nations.
A national type pursues its way physically and intellectually
through changes and developments answering
to those of the individual, and being represented by
Infancy, Childhood, Youth, Manhood, Old Age, and Death
respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disturbance
through emigration.</div>

<p>But this orderly process may be disturbed exteriorly or
interiorly. If from its original seats a whole
nation were transposed to some new abode, in
which the climate, the seasons, the aspect of
nature were altogether different, it would appear spontaneously
in all its parts to commence a movement to
come into harmony with the new conditions&mdash;a movement
of a secular nature, and implying the consumption of many
generations for its accomplishment. During such a period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of transmutation there would, of course, be an increased
waste of life, a risk, indeed, of total disappearance or
national death; but the change once completed, the
requisite correspondence once attained, things would go
forward again in an orderly manner on the basis of the
new modification that had been assumed. When the
change to be accomplished is very profound, involving
extensive anatomical alterations not merely in the appearance
of the skin, but even in the structure of the skull,
long periods of time are undoubtedly required, and many
generations of individuals are consumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And through
blood admixture.</div>

<p>Or, by interior disturbance, particularly by blood admixture,
with more rapidity may a national
type be affected, the result plainly depending
on the extent to which admixture has taken
place. This is a disturbance capable of mathematical
computation. If the blood admixture be only of limited
amount, and transient in its application, its effect will
sensibly disappear in no very great period of time, though
never, perhaps, in absolute reality. This accords with
the observation of philosophical historians, who agree in
the conclusion that a small tribe intermingling with a
larger one will only disturb it in a temporary manner,
and, after the course of a few years, the effect will cease to
be perceptible. Nevertheless, the influence must really
continue much longer than is outwardly apparent; and
the result is the same as when, in a liquid, a drop of some
other kind is placed, and additional quantities of the first
liquid then successively added. Though it might have
been possible at first to detect the adulteration without
trouble, it becomes every moment less and less possible to
do so, and before long it cannot be done at all. But the
drop is as much present at last as it was at first: it is
merely masked; its properties overpowered.</p>

<p>Considering in this manner the contamination of a
numerous nation, a trifling amount of foreign blood admixture
would appear to be indelible, and the disturbance,
at any moment, capable of computation by the ascertained
degree of dilution that has taken place. But it must not
be forgotten that there is another agency at work,
energetically tending to bring about homogeneity: it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
is the influence of external physical conditions. The
intrusive adulterating element possesses in itself no
physiological inertia, but as quickly as may be is brought
into correspondence with the new circumstances to which
it is exposed, herein running in the same course as the
element with which it had mingled had itself antecedently
gone over.</p>

<p>National homogeneity is thus obviously secured by
the operation of two distinct agencies: the first, gradual
but inevitable dilution; the second, motion to come into
harmony with the external natural state. The two
conspire in their effects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secular variations
of
nations.</div>

<p>We must therefore no longer regard nations or groups
of men as offering a permanent picture. Human affairs
must be looked upon as in continuous movement,
not wandering in an arbitrary manner
here and there, but proceeding in a perfectly
definite course. Whatever may be the present state, it is
altogether transient. All systems of civil life are therefore
necessarily ephemeral. Time brings new external
conditions; the manner of thought is modified; with
thought, action. Institutions of all kinds must hence
<span class="sidenote">Their institutions must
correspondingly change.</span>
participate in this fleeting nature, and, though they may
have allied themselves to political power, and gathered
therefrom the means of coercion, their permanency is but
little improved thereby; for, sooner or later, the population
on whom they have been imposed, following
the external variations, spontaneously outgrows
them, and their ruin, though it may have been
delayed, is none the less certain. For the
permanency of any such system it is essentially
necessary that it should include within its own organization
a law of change, and not of change only, but change
in the right direction&mdash;the direction in which the society
interested is about to pass. It is in an oversight of this last
essential condition that we find an explanation of the
failure of so many such institutions. Too commonly do
we believe that the affairs of men are determined by a
spontaneous action or free will; we keep that overpowering
influence which really controls them in the background.
In individual life we also accept a like deception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
living in the belief that every thing we do is determined
by the volition of ourselves or of those around us; nor is
it until the close of our days that we discern how great is
the illusion, and that we have been swimming&mdash;playing
and struggling&mdash;in a stream which, in spite of all our
voluntary motions, has silently and resistlessly borne us to
a predetermined shore.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages I have been tracing analogies
between the life of individuals and that of nations. There
is yet one point more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The death of
nations.</div>

<p>Nations, like individuals, die. Their birth presents an
ethnical element; their death, which is the most
solemn event that we can contemplate, may
arise from interior or from external causes. Empires are
only sand-hills in the hour-glass of Time; they crumble
spontaneously away by the process of their own growth.</p>

<p>A nation, like a man, hides from itself the contemplation
of its final day. It occupies itself with expedients
for prolonging its present state. It frames laws and
constitutions under the delusion that they will last, forgetting
that the condition of life is change. Very able
modern statesmen consider it to be the grand object of
their art to keep things as they are, or rather as they
were. But the human race is not at rest; and bands with
which, for a moment, it may be restrained, break all the
more violently the longer they hold. No man can stop
the march of destiny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There is nothing
absolute
in time.</div>

<p>Time, to the nation as to the individual, is nothing
absolute; its duration depends on the rate of
thought and feeling. For the same reason that
to the child the year is actually longer than to
the adult, the life of a nation may be said to be no longer
than the life of a person, considering the manner in which
its affairs are moving. There is a variable velocity of
existence, though the lapses of time may be equable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nations are
only transitional
forms.</div>

<p>The origin, existence, and death of nations depend thus
on physical influences, which are themselves the
result of immutable laws. Nations are only
transitional forms of humanity. They must
undergo obliteration as do the transitional forms offered
by the animal series. There is no more an immortality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for them than there is an immobility for an embryo in
any one of the manifold forms passed through in its
progress of development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their course
is ever advancing,
never retrograde.</div>

<p>The life of a nation thus flows in a regular sequence,
determined by invariable law, and hence, in estimating
different nations, we must not be deceived by the casual
aspect they present. The philosophical comparison
is made by considering their entire
manner of career or cycle of progress, and not
their momentary or transitory state. Though
they may encounter disaster, their absolute course can
never be retrograde; it is always onward, even if tending
to dissolution. It is as with the individual, who is
equally advancing in infancy, in maturity, in old age.
Pascal was more than justified in his assertion that "the
entire succession of men, through the whole course of ages,
must be regarded as one man, always living and incessantly
learning." In both cases, the manner of advance,
though it may sometimes be unexpected, can never be
abrupt. At each stage events and ideas emerge which
not only necessarily owe their origin to preceding events
<span class="sidenote">Variable rapidity
of national life.</span>
and ideas, but extend far into the future and influence it.
As these are crowded together, or occur more widely
apart, national life, like individual, shows a
variable rapidity, depending upon the intensity
of thought and action. But, no matter how
great that energy may be, or with what rapidity modifications
may take place&mdash;since events are emerging as
consequences of preceding events, and ideas from preceding
ideas&mdash;in the midst of the most violent intellectual
oscillations, a discerning observer will never fail to detect
that there exists a law of continuous variation of human
opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan of this
work.</div>

<p>In the examination of the progress of Europe on which
we now enter, it is, of course, to intellectual
phenomena that we must, for the most part,
refer; material aggrandisement and political power offering
us less important though still valuable indications, and
serving our purpose rather in a corroborative way. There
are five intellectual manifestations to which we may
resort&mdash;philosophy, science, literature, religion, government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Selection among European
communities.</span>
Our obvious course is, first, to study the progress
of that member of the European family, the
eldest in point of advancement, and to endeavour
to ascertain the characteristics of its mental
unfolding. We may reasonably expect that the
younger members of the family, more or less distinctly,
will offer us illustrations of the same mode of advancement
that we shall thus find for Greece; and that the
whole continent, which is the sum of these different
parts, will, in its secular progress, comport itself in like
manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our investigation limited
to the intellectual, and commencing with Greece.<br />
From thence we pass to the
examination of all Europe.</div>

<p>Of the early condition of Europe, since we have to
consider it in its prehistoric times, our information must
necessarily be imperfect. Perhaps, however, we may be
disposed to accept that imperfection as a sufficient token
of its true nature. Since history can offer us no aid, our
guiding lights must be comparative theology and comparative
philology. Proceeding from those times,
we shall, in detail, examine the intellectual or
philosophical movement first exhibited in Greece,
endeavouring to ascertain its character at successive
epochs, and thereby to judge of its
complete nature. Fortunately for our purpose,
the information is here sufficient, both in amount and
distinctness. It then remains to show that the mental
movement of the whole continent is essentially
of the same kind, though, as must necessarily be
the case, it is spread over far longer periods of
time. Our conclusions will constantly be found
to gather incidental support and distinctness from illustrations
presented by the aged populations of Asia, and the
aborigines of Africa and America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The five ages
of European
life.</div>

<p>The intellectual progress of Europe being of a nature
answering to that observed in the case of Greece,
and this, in its turn, being like that of an individual,
we may conveniently separate it into
arbitrary periods, sufficiently distinct from one another,
though imperceptibly merging into each other. To these
successive periods I shall give the titles of&mdash;1, the Age of
Credulity; 2, the Age of Inquiry; 3, the Age of Faith;
4, the Age of Reason; 5, the Age of Decrepitude; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
shall use these designations in the division of my subject
in its several chapters.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">The world is ruled by law.</span>
From the possibility of thus regarding the progress of
a continent in definite and successive stages, answering
respectively to the periods of individual life&mdash;infancy,
childhood, youth, maturity, old age&mdash;we may gather an
instructive lesson. It is the same that we have learned
from inquiries respecting the origin, maintenance, distribution,
and extinction of animals and plants, their balancing
against each other; from the variations of aspect and form
of an individual man as determined by climate; from his
social state, whether in repose or motion; from the secular
variations of his opinions, and the gradual
dominion of reason over society: this lesson is,
that the government of the world is accomplished by
immutable law.</p>

<p>Such a conception commends itself to the intellect of
man by its majestic grandeur. It makes him discern the
eternal in the vanishing of present events and through
the shadows of time. From the life, the pleasures, the
sufferings of humanity, it points to the impassive; from
our wishes, wants, and woes, to the inexorable. Leaving
the individual beneath the eye of Providence, it shows
society under the finger of law. And the laws of Nature
never vary; in their application they never hesitate nor
are wanting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And yet there
is free-will for
man.</div>

<p>But in thus ascending to primordial laws, and asserting
their immutability, universality, and paramount control in
the government of this world, there is nothing inconsistent
with the free action of man. The appearance
of things depends altogether on the point of
view we occupy. He who is immersed in the
turmoil of a crowded city sees nothing but the acts of
men, and, if he formed his opinion from his experience
alone, must conclude that the course of events altogether
depends on the uncertainties of human volition. But he
who ascends to a sufficient elevation loses sight of the
passing conflicts, and no longer hears the contentions.
He discovers that the importance of individual action is
diminishing, as the panorama beneath him is extending.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
And if he could attain to the truly philosophical, the
general point of view, disengaging himself front all terrestrial
influences and entanglements, rising high enough
to see the whole globe at a glance, his acutest vision would
fail to discover the slightest indication of man, his free-will,
or his works. In her resistless, onward sweep, in the
clock-like precision of her daily and nightly revolution, in
the well-known pictured forms of her continents and seas,
now no longer dark and doubtful, but shedding forth
a planetary light, well might he ask what had become of
all the aspirations and anxieties, the pleasures and agony
of life. As the voluntary vanished from his sight, and
the irresistible remained, and each moment became more
and more distinct, well might he incline to disbelieve his
own experience, and to question whether the seat of so
much undying glory could be the place of so much human
uncertainty, whether beneath the vastness, energy, and
immutable course of a moving world, there lay concealed
the feebleness and imbecility of man. Yet it is none the less
true that these contradictory conditions co-exist&mdash;Free-will
and Fate, Uncertainty and Destiny, It is only the point
of view that has changed, but on that how much has
depended! A little nearer we gather the successive ascertainments
of human inquiry, a little further off we realize
the panoramic vision of the Deity. A Hindu philosopher
has truly remarked, that he who stands by the banks of
a flowing stream sees, in their order, the various parts as
they successively glide by, but he who is placed on an
exalted station views, at a glance, the whole as a
motionless silvery thread among the fields. To the one
there is the accumulating experience and knowledge of
man in time, to the other there is the instantaneous the
unsuccessive knowledge of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changeability
of forms and
unchangeability
of law.</div>

<p>Is there an object presented to us which does not
bear the mark of ephemeral duration? As
respects the tribes of life, they are scarcely
worth a moment's thought, for the term of the
great majority of them is so brief that we
may say they are born and die before our eyes. If we
examine them, not as individuals, but as races, the same
conclusion holds good, only the scale is enlarged from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
few days to a few centuries. If from living we turn to
lifeless nature, we encounter again the evidence of brief
continuance. The sea is unceasingly remoulding its
shores; hard as they are, the mountains are constantly
yielding to frost and to rain; here an extensive tract of
country is elevated, there depressed. We fail to find any
thing that is not undergoing change.</p>

<p>Then forms are in their nature transitory, law is everlasting.
If from visible forms we turn to directing law
how vast is the difference. We pass from the finite,
the momentary, the incidental, the conditioned&mdash;to the
illimitable, the eternal, the necessary, the unshackled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The object of
this book is to
assert the control
of law in
human affairs.</div>

<p>It is of law that I am to speak in this book. In a
world composed of vanishing forms I am to
vindicate the imperishability, the majesty of
law, and to show how man proceeds, in his
social march, in obedience to it. I am to lead
my reader, perhaps in a reluctant path, from the outward
phantasmagorial illusions which surround us, and so
ostentatiously obtrude themselves on our attention, to
something that lies in silence and strength behind. I am to
draw his thoughts from the tangible to the invisible, from
the limited to the universal, from the changeable to the
invariable, from the transitory to the eternal; from the
expedients and volitions so largely amusing the life of
man, to the predestined and resistless issuing from the
fiat of God.

<p><span class="smcap">Europe</span> is geographically a peninsula, and historically a
dependency of Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of
Europe.</div>

<p>It is constructed on the western third of a vast
mountain axis, which reaches in a broken and
irregular course from the Sea of Japan to the
Bay of Biscay. On the flanks of this range, peninsular
slopes are directed toward the south, and extensive
plateaus to the north. The culminating point in Europe
is Mont Blanc, 16,000 feet above the level of the sea.
The axis of elevation is not the axis of figure; the incline
to the south is much shorter and steeper than that to the
north. The boundless plains of Asia are prolonged
through Germany and Holland. An army may pass from
the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of more than
six thousand miles, without encountering any elevation of
more than a few hundred feet. The descent from Asia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
into Europe is indicated in a general manner by the mean
<span class="sidenote">The great path-zone.</span>
elevation of the two continents above the level of the sea;
that for Asia being 1132 feet, that for Europe 671.
Through the avenue thus open to them, the Oriental
hordes have again and again precipitated themselves
on the West. With an abundance of
springs and head-waters, but without any stream capable
of offering a serious obstacle, this tract has a temperature
well suited to military movements. It coincides generally
with the annual isothermal line of 50°, skirting the
northern boundary beyond which the vine ceases to grow,
and the limiting region beyond which the wild boar does
not pass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exterior and
interior accessibility.</div>

<p>Constructed thus, Europe is not only easily accessible
from Asia, a fact of no little moment in its
ancient history, but it is also singularly accessible
interiorly, or from one of its parts to
another. Still more, its sea-line is so broken, it has so
many intrusive gulfs and bays, that, its surface considered,
its maritime coast is greater than that of any other continent.
In this respect it contrasts strikingly with
Africa. Europe has one mile of coast-line for every 156
square miles of surface, Africa has only one for every 623.
This extensive maritime contact adds, of course, greatly
to its interior as well as exterior accessibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution
of heat in
Europe.</div>

<p>The mean annual temperature of the European countries
on the southern slope of the mountain axis is from 60° to
70° F., but of those to the north the heat gradually
declines, until, at the extreme limit on the shores of
Zembla, the ground is perpetually frozen. As on other
parts of the globe, the climate does not correspond
to the latitude, but is disturbed by several
causes, among which may be distinguished the
great Atlantic current&mdash;the Gulf Stream coming
from America&mdash;and the Sahara Desert. The latter gives
to the south of Europe an unduly high heat, and the
former to Ireland, England, and the entire west a genial
temperature. Together they press into higher latitudes
the annual isothermal lines. If in Europe there are no
deserts, there are none of those impenetrable forests seen
in tropical countries. From the westerly shores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Portugal, France, and Ireland, the humidity diminishes as
we pass to the east, and, indeed, if we advance into Asia,
it disappears in the desert of Gobi. There are no vast
homogeneous areas as in Asia, and therefore there is no
widespread uniformity in the races of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And the quantity
of rain.</div>

<p>But not only is the temperature of the European continent
elevated by the Gulf Stream and the south-west
wind, its luxuriance of vegetation depends on them;
for luxuriance of vegetation is determined, among other
things, by the supply of rain. A profusion of
water gives to South America its amazing forests;
a want inflicts on Australia its shadeless trees, with their
shrunken and pointed leaves. With the diminished
moisture the green gardens of France are replaced in Gobi
by ligneous plants covered with a gray down. Physical
circumstances control the vegetable as well as the animal
world.</p>

<p>The westerly regions of Europe, through the influence of
the south-west wind, the Gulf Stream, and their mountain
ranges, are supplied with abundant rains, and have a
favourable mean annual temperature; but as we pass to
the eastern confines the number of rainy days diminishes,
the absolute annual quantity of rain and snow is less, and
the mean annual temperature is lower. On the Atlantic
face of the mountains of Norway it is perpetually raining:
the annual depth of water is there 82 inches; but on the
opposite side of those mountains is only 21 inches.
For similar reasons, Ireland is moist and green, and in
Cornwall the laurel and camellia will bear a winter
exposure.</p>

<p>There are six maximum points of rain&mdash;Norway, Scotland,
South-western Ireland and England, Portugal,
North-eastern Spain, Lombardy. They respectively correspond
to mountains. In general, the amount of rain
diminishes from the equator toward the poles; but it is
greatly controlled by the disturbing influence of elevated
ridges, which in many instances far more than compensate
for the effects of latitude. The Alps exercise an influence
over the meteorology of all Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The number
of rainy days;</div>

<p>Not only do mountains thus determine the absolute
quantity of rain, they also affect the number of rainy days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in a year. The occurrence of a rainy season depends on
the amount of moisture existing in the air; and hence its
frequency is greater at the Atlantic sea-board than in the
interior, where the wind arrives in a drier state, much of
its moisture having been precipitated by the mountains
forcing it to a great elevation. Thus, on the
eastern coast of Ireland it rains 208 days in a
year; in England, about 150; at Kazan, 90; and in
Siberia only 60 days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of snowy
days.</div>

<p>When the atmospheric temperature is sufficiently low,
the condensed water descends under the form of snow. In
general, the annual depth of snow and the number of
snowy days increase toward the north. In Rome the
snowy days are 1&frac12;; in Venice, 5&frac12;; in Paris, 12;
in St. Petersburgh, 171. Whatever causes interfere
with the distribution of heat must influence the
precipitation of snow; among such are the Gulf Stream
and local altitude. Hence, on the coast of Portugal, snow
is of infrequent occurrence; in Lisbon it never snowed
from 1806 to 1811.</p>

<p>Such facts teach us how many meteorological contrasts
Europe presents, how many climates it contains. Necessarily
it is full of modified men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vibrations of
the isothermal
lines.</div>

<p>If we examine the maps of monthly isothermals, we
observe how strikingly those lines change, becoming
convex to the north as summer approaches,
and concave as winter. They by no means
observe a parallelism to the mean, but change their flexures,
assuming new sinuosities. In their absolute transfer
they move with a variable velocity, and through spaces
far from insignificant. The line of 50° F., which in
January passes through Lisbon and the south of the
Morea, in July has travelled to the north shore of Lapland,
and incloses the White Sea. As in some grand
musical instrument, the strings of which vibrate, the
isothermal lines of Europe and Asia beat to and fro, but it
takes a year for them to accomplish one pulsation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Europe is full
of meteorological
contrasts,
and
therefore of
modified men.</div>

<p>All over the world physical circumstances control the
human race. They make the Australian a savage; incapacitate
the negro, who can never invent an alphabet
or an arithmetic, and whose theology never passes beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the stage of sorcery. They cause the Tartars to delight
in a diet of milk, and the American Indian to
abominate it. They make the dwarfish races of
Europe instinctive miners and metallurgists. An
artificial control over temperature by dwellings,
warm for the winter and cool for the summer;
variations of clothing to suit the season of the year, and
especially the management of fire, have enabled man to
maintain himself in all climates. The invention of artificial
light has extended the available term of his life; by
giving the night to his use, it has, by the social intercourse
it encourages, polished his manners and refined his tastes,
perhaps as much as any thing else has aided in his intellectual
progress. Indeed, these are among the primary
conditions that have occasioned his civilization. Variety
of natural conditions gives rise to different national types,
artificial inventions occasion renewed modifications. Where
there are many climates there will be many forms of men.
Herein, as we shall in due season discover, lies the explanation
of the energy of European life, and the development
of its civilization.</p>

<p>Would any one deny the influence of rainy days on our
industrial habits and on our mental condition even in a
civilized state? With how much more force, then, must
such meteorological incidents have acted on the ill-protected,
ill-clad, and ill-housed barbarian! Would any one deny
the increasing difficulty with which life is maintained as
we pass from the southern peninsulas to the more rigorous
climates of the north? There is a relationship between
the mean annual heat of a locality and the instincts of its
inhabitants for food. The Sicilian is satisfied with a light
farinaceous repast and a few fruits; the Norwegian requires
a strong diet of flesh; to the Laplander it is none
the less acceptable if grease of the bear, or train oil, or the
blubber of whales be added. Meteorology to no little
extent influences the morals; the instinctive propensity
to drunkenness is a function of the latitude. Food, houses,
clothing, bear a certain relation to the isothermal lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But, through
artificial inventions,
it
tends to homogeneousness
in modern
times.</div>

<p>For similar reasons, the inhabitants of Europe each
year tend to more complete homogeneity. Climate and
meteorological differences are more and more perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
equalized by artificial inventions; nor is it alone a similarity
of habits, a similarity of physiological constitution
also ensues. The effect of such inventions
is to equalize the influences to which men are
exposed; they are brought more closely to the
mean typical standard, and&mdash;especially is it to be
remembered&mdash;with this closer approach to each other in
conformation, comes a closer approach in feelings and
habits, and even in the manner of thinking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mediterranean
peninsulas.</div>

<p>On the southern slope of the mountain axis project the
historic peninsulas, Greece, Italy, Spain. To
the former we trace unmistakably the commencement
of European civilization. The first
Greeks patriotically affirmed that their own climate was
the best suited for man; beyond the mountains to the
north there reigned a Cimmerian darkness, an everlasting
winter. It was the realm of Boreas, the shivering tyrant.
In the early ages man recognized cold as his mortal enemy.
Physical inventions have enabled him to overcome it, and
now he maintains a more difficult and doubtful struggle
with heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mediterranean
Sea.</div>

<p>Beyond these peninsulas, and bounding the continent on
the south, is the Mediterranean, nearly two
thousand miles in length, isolating Europe from
Africa socially, but uniting them commercially. The
Black Sea and that of Azof are dependencies of it. It has,
conjointly with them, a shore-line of 13,000 miles, and
exposes a surface of nearly a million and a quarter of
square miles. It is subdivided into two basins, the eastern
and western, the former being of high interest historically,
since it is the scene of the dawn of European intelligence;
the western is bounded by the Italian peninsula, Sicily,
and the African promontory of Cape Bon on one side, and
at the other has as its portal the Straits of Gibraltar.
The temperature is ten or twelve degrees higher than the
Atlantic, and, since much of the water is removed by
evaporation, it is necessarily more saline than that ocean.
Its colour is green where shallow, blue where deep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secular geological
movement
of Europe
and Asia,
and its social
consequences.</div>

<p>For countless centuries Asia has experienced a slow upward
movement, not only affecting her own topography,
but likewise that of her European dependency. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was a time when the great sandy desert of Gobi was the
bed of a sea which communicated through the
Caspian with the Baltic, as may be proved not
only by existing geographical facts, but also
from geological considerations. It is only necessary,
for this purpose, to inspect the imperfect
maps that have been published of the Silurian and even
tertiary periods. The vertical displacement of Europe,
during and since the latter period, has indisputably been
more than 2000 feet in many places. The effects of such
movements on the flora and fauna of a region must, in the
course of time, be very important, for an elevation of 350
feet is equal to one degree of cold in the mean annual temperature,
or to sixty miles on the surface northward. Nor has
this slow disturbance ended. Again and again, in historic
times, have its results operated fearfully on Europe, by
forcibly precipitating the Asiatic nomades along the great
path-zone; again and again, through such changes of level,
have they been rendered waterless, and thus driven into a
forced emigration. Some of their rivers, as the Oxus and
Jaxartes, have, within the records of history, been dry for
several years. To these topographical changes, rather
than to political influences, we must impute many of the
most celebrated tribal invasions. It has been the custom
to refer these events to an excessive overpopulation periodically
occurring in Central Asia, or to the ambition of
warlike chieftains. Doubtless those regions are well
adapted to human life, and hence liable to overpopulation,
considering the pursuits man there follows, and doubtless
there have been occasions on which those nations have
been put in motion by their princes; but the modern
historian cannot too carefully bear in mind the laws which
regulate the production of men, and also the body of
evidence which proves that the crust of the earth is not
motionless, but rising in one place and sinking in another.
The grand invasions of Europe by Asiatic hordes have
been much more violent and abrupt than would answer to
a steady pressure resulting from overpopulation, and too
extensive for mere warlike incitement; they answer more
completely to the experience of some irresistible necessity
arising from an insuperable physical cause, which could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
drive in hopeless despair from their homes the young and
the old, the vigorous and feeble, with their cattle, and
waggons, and flocks. Such a cause is the shifting of the
soil and disturbance of the courses of water. The tribes
compelled to migrate were forced along the path-zone,
their track being, therefore, on a parallel of latitude, and
not on a meridian; and hence, for the reasons set forth in
the preceding chapter, their movements and journey of
easier accomplishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rate and extent
of these
movements.</div>

<p>These geological changes then enter as an element in
human history, not only for Asia, of which the
great inland sea has dwindled away to the
Caspian, and lost its connection with the Baltic,
but for Europe also. The traditions of ancient deluges,
which are the primitive facts of Greek history, refer to
such movements, perhaps the opening of the Thracian
Bosphorus was one of them. In much later times we are
perpetually meeting with incidents depending on geological
disturbances; the caravan trade of Asia Minor was destroyed
by changes of level and the accumulation of sands
blown from the encroaching deserts; the Cimbri were
impelled into Italy by the invasion of the sea on their
possessions. There is not a shore in Europe which does
not give similar evidence; the mouths of the Rhine, as
they were in the Roman times, are obliterated; the
eastern coast of England has been cut away for miles.
In the Mediterranean the shore-line is altogether changed;
towns, once on the coast, are far away inland; others have
sunk beneath the sea. Islands, like Rhodes, have risen
from the bottom. The North Adriatic, once a deep gulf,
has now become shallow; there are leaning towers and
inclining temples that have sunk with the settling of the
earth. On the opposite extremity of Europe, the Scandinavian
peninsula furnishes an instance of slow secular
motion, the northern part rising gradually above the sea
at the rate of about four feet in a century. This elevation
is observed through a space of many hundred miles, increasing
toward the north. The southern extremity, on
the contrary, experiences a slow depression.</p>

<p>These slow movements are nothing more than a continuation
of what has been going on for numberless ages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Since the tertiary period two-thirds of Europe have been
lifted above the sea. The Norway coast has been elevated
600 feet, the Alps have been upheaved 2000 or 3000, the
Apennines 1000 to 2000 feet. The country between Mont
Blanc and Vienna has been thus elevated since the adjacent
seas were peopled with existing animals. Since the
Neolithic age, the British Islands have undergone a great
change of level, and, indeed, have been separated from the
continent through the sinking of England and the rising
of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early inhabitants
of
Europe.</div>

<p>At the earliest period Europe presents us with a double
population. An Indo-Germanic column had entered it
from the east, and had separated into two portions the
occupants it had encountered, driving one to the north, the
other to the south-west. These primitive tribes betray,
physiologically, a Mongolian origin; and there
are indications of considerable weight that they
themselves had been, in ancient times, intruders,
who, issuing from their seats in Asia, had invaded and
dislocated the proper autochthons of Europe. In the
Pleistocene age there existed in Central Europe a rude
race of hunters and fishers, closely allied to the Esquimaux.
Man was contemporary with the cave bear, the cave lion,
the amphibious hippopotamus, the mammoth. Caves that
have been examined in France or elsewhere have furnished
for the stone age, axes, knives, lance and arrow points,
scrapers, hammers. The change from what has been
termed the chipped, to the polished stone period, was very
gradual. It coincides with the domestication of the dog,
an epoch in hunting life. The appearance of arrow heads
indicates the invention of the bow, and the rise of man
from a defensive to an offensive mode of life. The introduction
of barbed arrows shows how inventive talent was
displaying itself; bone and horn tips, that the huntsman
was including smaller animals, and perhaps birds, in his
chase; bone whistles, his companionship with other huntsmen,
or with his dog. The scraping knives of flint, indicate
the use of skin for clothing, and rude bodkins and
needles, its manufacture. Shells perforated for bracelets
and necklaces, prove how soon a taste for personal adornment
was acquired, the implements necessary for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
preparation of pigments suggest the painting of the body,
and perhaps, tattooing; and batons of rank bear witness to
the beginning of a social organization.</p>

<p>We have thus as our starting-point a barbarian population,
believers in sorcery, and, in some places, undoubtedly
cannibals, maintaining, in the central and northern parts
of Europe, their existence with difficulty by reason of the
severity of the climate. In the southern, more congenial
conditions permitted a form of civilization to commence,
of which the rude Cyclopean structures here and there
met with, such as the ruins of Orchomenos, the lion gate
of Mycenæ, the tunnel of Lake Copais, are perhaps the
vestiges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their social
condition.</div>

<p>At what period this intrusive Indo-Germanic column
made its attack cannot be ascertained. The national
vocabularies of Europe, to which we must resort for
evidence, might lead us to infer that the condition of civilization
of the conquering people was not very
advanced. They were acquainted with the use
of domestic animals, farming implements, carts, and
yokes; they were also possessed of boats, the rudder, oars,
but were unacquainted with the movement of vessels by
sails. These conclusions seem to be established by the
facts that words equivalent to boat, rudder, oar, are
common to the languages of the offshoots of the stock,
though located very widely asunder; but those for mast
and sails are of special invention, and differ in adjacent
nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their civil
state deduced
from their vocabularies.</div>

<p>In nearly all the Indo-Germanic tongues, the family
names, father, mother, brother, sister, daughter, are the
same respectively. A similar equivalence may
be observed in a great many familiar objects,
house, door, town, path. It has been remarked,
that while this holds good for terms of a peaceful
nature, many of those connected with warfare and
the chase are different in different languages. Such
facts appear to prove that the Asiatic invaders followed
a nomadic and pastoral life. Many of the terms
connected with such an avocation are widely diffused.
This is the case with ploughing, grinding, weaving, cooking,
baking, sewing, spinning; with such objects as corn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
flesh, meat, vestment; with wild animals common to
Europe and Asia, as the bear and the wolf. So, too, of
words connected with social organization, despot, rex,
queen. The numerals from 1 to 100 coincide in Sanscrit,
Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic; but this is not the case
with 1000, a fact which has led comparative philologists
to the conclusion that, though at the time of the emigration
a sufficient intellectual advance had been made to
invent the decimal system, perhaps from counting upon
the fingers, yet that it was very far from perfection. To
the inhabitants of Central Asia the sea was altogether
unknown; hence the branches of the emigrating column,
as they diverged north and south, gave it different names.
But, though unacquainted with the sea, they were familiar
with salt, as is proved by the recurrence of its name.
Nor is it in the vocabularies alone that these resemblances
are remarked; the same is to be said of the grammar.
M. Max Müller shows that in Sanscrit, Zend, Lithuanian,
Doric, Slavonic, Latin, Gothic, the forms of the auxiliary
verb <i>to be</i> are all varieties of one common type, and that
"the coincidences between the language of the Veda and
the dialect spoken at the present day by the Lithuanian
recruits at Berlin are greater by far than between French
and Italian, and that the essential forms of grammar had
been fully framed and established before the first separation
of the Aryan family took place."</p>

<p>But it should not be overlooked that such interesting
deductions founded on language, its vocabularies and
grammar, must not be pressed too closely. The state of
civilization of the Indo-Germanic column, as thus ascertained,
must needs have been inferior to that of the centre
from which it issued forth. Such we observe to be the
case in all migratory movements. It is not the more
intellectual or civilized portions of a community which
voluntarily participate therein, but those in whom the
physical and animal character predominates. There may
be a very rough offshoot from a very polished stock. Of
course, the movement we are here considering must have
taken place at a period chronologically remote, yet not so
remote as might seem to be indicated by the state of civilization
of the invaders, used as an indication of the state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of civilization of the country from which they had come.
In Asia, social advancement, as far back as we can discover,
has ever been very slow; but, at the first moment that we
encounter the Hindu race historically or philologically, it
is dealing with philosophical and theological questions of
the highest order, and settling, to its own satisfaction,
problems requiring a cultivated intellect even so much as
to propose. All this implies that in its social advancement
there must have already been consumed a very long
period of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commingling
of blood and
of ideas.</div>

<p>But what chiefly interests us is the relation which must
have been necessarily maintained between the intrusive
people and those whom they thus displaced, the commingling
of the ideas of the one with those of
the other, arising from their commingling of
blood. It is because of this that we find coexisting
in the pre-Hellenic times the sorcery of the Celt and
the polytheism of the Hindu. There can be no doubt
that many of the philosophical lineaments displayed by
the early European mythology are not due to indigenous
thought, but were derived from an Asiatic source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Climate-modification
of
Asiatic intruders.</div>

<p>Moreover, at the earliest historic times, notwithstanding
the disturbance which must have lasted long after the
successful and perhaps slow advance of the Asiatic column,
things had come to a state of equilibrium or repose, not
alone socially, but also physiologically. It takes a long
time for the conqueror and conquered to settle together,
without farther disturbance or question, into their relative
positions; it takes a long time for the recollection of
conflicts to die away. But far longer does it take for a
race of invaders to come into unison with the climate of
the countries they have seized, the system of
man accommodating itself only through successive
generations, and therefore very slowly,
to new physical conditions. It takes long before
the skin assumes its determinate hue, and the skull
its destined form. A period amply sufficient for all such
changes to be accomplished in Europe had transpired at
the very dawn of history, and strands of population in conformity
with meteorological and geographical influences,
though of such origin as has been described, were already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
distributed upon it. A condition of ethnical equilibrium
had been reached. Along each isothermal or climatic band
were its correspondingly modified men, spending their
lives in avocations dictated by their environment. These
strands of population were destined to be dislocated, and
some of them to become extinct, by inventing or originating
among themselves new and unsuitable artificial physical
conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First gleams
of civilization</div>

<p>Already Europe was preparing a repetition of those
events of which Asia from time immemorial has been the
scene. Already among the nations bordering on the
Mediterranean, inhabitants of a pleasant climate, in which
life could be easily maintained&mdash;where the isothermal of
January is 41° F., and of July 73&frac12;° F.&mdash;civilization
was commencing. There was an improving
agriculture, an increasing commerce, and, the necessary
consequence thereof, germs of art, the accumulation of
wealth. The southern peninsulas were offering to the
warlike chieftains of middle Europe a tempting prize.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and first religious
opinions.</div>

<p>Under such influences Europe may be considered as
emerging from the barbarian state. It had lost
all recollection of its ancient relations with India,
which have only been disclosed to us by a study of the
vocabularies and grammar of its diverse tongues. Upon
its indigenous sorcery an Oriental star-worship had been
ingrafted, the legends of which had lost their significance.
What had at first been feigned of the heavenly bodies had
now assumed an air of personality, and had become
attributed to heroes and gods.</p>

<p>The negro under the equinoctial line, the dwarfish Laplander
beyond the Arctic Circle&mdash;man everywhere, in his
barbarous state, is a believer in sorcery, witchcraft, enchantments;
he is fascinated by the incomprehensible.
Any unexpected sound or sudden motion he refers to
invisible beings. Sleep and dreams, in which one-third
of his life is spent, assure him that there is a spiritual
world. He multiplies these unrealities; he gives to every
grotto a genius; to every tree, spring, river, mountain, a
divinity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Localization of
the invisible.</div>

<p>Comparative theology, which depends on the law of
continuous variation of human thought, and is indeed one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of its expressions, universally proves that the moment
man adopts the idea of an existence of invisible
beings, he recognizes the necessity of places for
their residence, all nations assigning them habitations
beyond the boundaries of the earth. A local heaven and
a local hell are found in every mythology. In Greece,
as to heaven, there was a universal agreement that it was
situated above the blue sky; but as to hell, much difference
of opinion prevailed. There were many who thought that
it was a deep abyss in the interior of the earth, to which
certain passages, such as the Acherusian cave in Bithynia,
led. But those who with Anaximenes considered the
earth to be like a broad leaf floating in the air, and who
accepted the doctrine that hell was divided into a Tartarus,
or region of night on the left, and an Elysium, or region
of dawn on the right, and that it was equally distant from
all parts of the upper surface, were nearer to the original
conception, which doubtless placed it on the under or
shadowy side of the earth. The portals of descent were
thus in the west, where the sun and stars set, though here
and there were passages leading through the ground to
the other side, such as those by which Hercules and
Ulysses had gone. The place of ascent was in the east,
and the morning twilight a reflection from the Elysian
Fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The anthropocentric
stage
of thought.</div>

<p>The picture of Nature thus interpreted has for its centre
the earth; for its most prominent object, man.
Whatever there is has been made for his pleasure,
or to minister to his use. To this belief that
every thing is of a subordinate value compared with himself,
he clings with tenacity even in his most advanced
mental state.</p>

<p>Not without surprise do we trace the progress of the
human mind. The barbarian, as a believer in sorcery, lives
in incessant dread. All Nature seems to be at enmity with
him and conspiring for his hurt. Out of the darkness he
cannot tell what alarming spectre may emerge; he may,
with reason, fear that injury is concealed in every stone,
and hidden behind every leaf. How wide is the interval
from this terror-stricken condition to that state in which
man persuades himself of the human destiny of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
universe! Yet, wonderful to be said, he passes that
interval at a single step.</p>

<p>In the infancy of the human race, geographical and
astronomical ideas are the same all over the world, for
they are the interpretation of things according to outward
appearances, the accepting of phenomena as they are presented,
without any of the corrections that reason may
offer. This universality and homogeneity is nothing
more than a manifestation of the uniform mode of action
of human organization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From homogeneous ideas
the comparative sciences emerge.</div>

<p>But such homogeneous conclusions, such similar pictures,
are strictly peculiar to the infancy of humanity.
The reasoning faculty at length inevitably makes
itself felt, and diversities of interpretation ensue.
Comparative geography, comparative astronomy,
comparative theology thus arise, homogeneous at first, but
soon exhibiting variations.</p>

<p>To that tendency for personification which marks the
early life of man are due many of the mythologic conceptions.
It was thus that the Hours, the Dawn, and Night
with her black mantle bespangled with stars,
<span class="sidenote">Introduction
of personified forms.</span>
received their forms. Many of the most beautiful
legends were thus of a personified astronomical
origin; many were derived from terrestrial or
familiar phenomena. The clouds were thus made to be
animated things; a moving spirit was given to the storm,
the dew, the wind. The sun setting in the glowing clouds
of the west became Hercules in the fiery pile; the morning
dawn extinguished by the rising sun was embodied in
the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. These legends still
survive in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gradual and affiliated
advance of Greek theological ideas.</div>

<p>But it must not be supposed that all Greek mythology
can be thus explained. It is enough for us to examine the
circumstances under which, for many ages, the European
communities had been placed, to understand that they had
forgotten much that their ancestors had brought
from Asia. Much that was new had also spontaneously
arisen. The well-known variations of
their theogony are not merely similar legends
of different localities, they are more frequently the successive
improvements of one place. The general theme upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which they are based requires the admission of a primitive
chaotic disturbance of incomprehensible gigantic powers,
brought into subjection by Divine agency, that agency
dividing and regulating the empire it had thus acquired
in a harmonious way. To this general conception was
added a multitude of adventitious ornaments, some of
which were of a rude astronomical, some of a moral, some,
doubtless, of a historical kind. The primitive chaotic
conflicts appear under the form of the war of the Titans;
their end is the confinement of those giants in Tartarus;
whose compulsory subjection is the commencement of order:
<span class="sidenote">The composite nature
of the resulting mythology.</span>
thus Atlas, the son of Iapetos, is made to sustain the vault
of heaven in its western verge. The regulation of empire
is shadowed forth in the subdivision of the universe
between Zeus and his brothers, he taking the
heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the under
world, all having the earth as their common
theatre of action. The moral is prefigured by
such myths as those of Prometheus and Epimetheus, the
fore-thinker and the after-thinker; the historical in the
deluge of Deucalion, the sieges of Thebes and of Troy. A
harmony with human nature is established through the
birth and marriage of the gods, and likewise by their
sufferings, passions, and labours. The supernatural is
gratified by Centaurs, Gorgons, Harpies, and Cyclops.</p>

<p>It would be in vain to attempt the reduction of such a
patchwork system to any single principle, astronomical
or moral, as some have tried to do&mdash;a system originating
from no single point as to country or to time. The
gradual growth of many ages, its diversities are due to
many local circumstances. Like the romances of a later
period, it will not bear an application of the ordinary rules
of life. It recommended itself to a people who found
pleasure in accepting without any question statements no
matter how marvellous, impostures no matter how preposterous.
Gods, heroes, monsters, and men might figure
together without any outrage to probability when there
was no astronomy, no geography, no rule of evidence, no
standard of belief. But the downfall of such a system was
inevitable as soon as men began to deal with facts; as soon
as history commenced to record, and philosophy to discuss.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Yet not without reluctance was the faith of so many
centuries given up. The extinction of a religion is not
the abrupt movement of a day, it is a secular process of
many well-marked stages&mdash;the rise of doubt among the
candid; the disapprobation of the conservative; the defence
of ideas fast becoming obsolete by the well-meaning, who
hope that allegory and new interpretations may give renewed
probability to what is almost incredible. But
dissent ends in denial at last.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive astronomy

<p>Before we enter upon the history of that intellectual
movement which thus occasioned the ruin of the ancient
system, we must bring to ourselves the ideas of the Greek
of the eighth century before Christ, who thought that the
blue sky is the floor of heaven, the habitation of the
Olympian gods; that the earth, man's proper
abode, is flat and circularly extended like a
plate beneath the starry canopy. On its rim is
the circumfluous ocean, the source of the rivers, which all
flow to the Mediterranean, appropriately in after ages so
called, since it is in the midst, in the centre of the expanse
of the land. "The sea-girt disk of the earth supports the
vault of heaven." Impelled by a celestial energy, the sun
and stars, issuing forth from the east, ascend with difficulty
the crystalline dome, but down its descent they
more readily hasten to their setting. No one can tell
what they encounter in the land of shadows beneath, nor
what are the dangers of the way. In the morning the
dawn mysteriously appears in the east, and swiftly spreads
over the confines of the horizon; in the evening the
twilight fades gradually away. Besides the celestial
bodies, the clouds are continually moving over the sky,
for ever changing their colours and their shape. No one
can tell whence the wind comes or whither it goes;
perhaps it is the breath of that invisible divinity who
launches the lightning, or of him who rests his bow
against the cloud. Not without delight men contemplated
the emerald plane, the sapphire dome, the border of
silvery water, ever tranquil and ever flowing.
<span class="sidenote">The under world and its
spectres.</span>
Then, in the interior of the solid earth, or perhaps
on the other side of its plane&mdash;under world,
as it was well termed&mdash;is the realm of Hades or Pluto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the region of Night. From the midst of his dominion, that
divinity, crowned with a diadem of ebony, and seated on
a throne framed out of massive darkness, looks into the
infinite abyss beyond, invisible himself to mortal eyes, but
made known by the nocturnal thunder which is his
weapon. The under world is also the realm to which
spirits retire after death. At its portals, beneath the
setting sun, is stationed a numerous tribe of spectres&mdash;Care,
Sorrow, Disease, Age, Want, Fear, Famine, War,
Toil, Death and her half-brother Sleep&mdash;Death, to whom
it is useless for man to offer either prayers or sacrifice.
In that land of forgetfulness and shadows there is the
unnavigable lake Avernus, Acheron, Styx, the groaning
Cocytus, and Phlegethon, with its waves of fire. There
are all kinds of monsters and forms of fearful import:
Cerberus, with his triple head; Charon, freighting his
boat with the shades of the dead; the Fates, in their
garments of ermine bordered with purple; the avenging
Erinnys; Rhadamanthus, before whom every Asiatic must
render his account; Æacus, before whom every European;
and Minos, the dread arbiter of the judgment-seat. There,
too, are to be seen those great criminals whose history is a
warning to us: the giants, with dragons' feet extended in
the burning gulf for many a mile; Phlegyas, in perpetual
terror of the stone suspended over him, which never falls;
Ixion chained to his wheel; the daughters of Danaus still
vainly trying to fill their sieve; Tantalus, immersed in
water to his chin, yet tormented with unquenchable
thirst; Sisyphus despairingly labouring at his ever-descending
stone. Warned by such examples, we may learn
not to contemn the gods. Beyond these sad scenes, extending
far to the right, are the plains of pleasure, the
Elysian Fields; and Lethe, the river of oblivion, of which
whoever tastes, though he should ascend to the eastern
boundary of the earth, and return again to life and day,
forgets whatever he has seen.</p>

<p>If the interior or the under side of the earth is thus
occupied by phantoms and half-animated shades of the
dead, its upper surface, inhabited by man, has also its
wonders. In its centre is the Mediterranean Sea, as we
have said, round which are placed all the known countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
each full of its own mysteries and marvels. Of these how
<span class="sidenote">The Argonautic voyage.</span>
many we might recount if we followed the wanderings of
Odysseus, or the voyage of Jason and his heroic
comrades in the ship <i>Argo</i>, when they went
to seize the golden fleece of the speaking ram. We
might tell of the Harpies, flying women-birds of obscene
form; of the blind prophet; of the Symplegades, self-shutting
rocks, between which, as if by miracle, the
Argonauts passed, the cliffs almost entrapping the stern of
their vessel, but destined by fate from that portentous
moment never to close again; of the country of the
Amazons, and of Prometheus groaning on the rock to
which he was nailed, of the avenging eagle for ever
hovering and for ever devouring; of the land of Æêtes,
and of the bulls with brazen feet and flaming breath, and
how Jason yoked and made them plough, of the enchantress
Medea, and the unguent she concocted from
herbs that grew where the blood of Prometheus had
dripped; of the field sown with dragons' teeth, and the
mail-clad men that leaped out of the furrows; of the
magical stone that divided them into two parties, and
impelled them to fight each other; of the scaly dragon
that guarded the golden fleece, and how he was lulled
with a charmed potion, and the treasure carried away; of
the River Phasis, through whose windings the <i>Argo</i>
sailed into the circumfluous sea, of the circumnavigation
round that tranquil stream to the sources of the Nile; of
the Argonauts carrying their sentient, self-speaking ship
on their shoulders through the sweltering Libyan deserts,
of the island of Circe, the enchantress; of the rock, with
its grateful haven, which in the height of a tempest rose
out of the sea to receive them; of the arrow shot by
Apollo from his golden bow; of the brazen man, the work
of Hephæstos, who stood on the shore of Crete, and hurled at
them as they passed vast fragments of stone; of their combat
with him and their safe return to Iolcos; and of the translation
of the ship <i>Argo</i> by the goddess Athene to heaven.</p>

<p>Such were some of the incidents of that celebrated
voyage, the story of which enchanted all Greece before the
Odyssey was written. I have not space to tell of the
wonders that served to decorate the geography of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
times. On the north there was the delicious country of
the Hyperboreans, beyond the reach of winter;
<span class="sidenote">Union of the geographical
and the marvellous.</span>
in the west the garden of the Hesperides, in
which grew apples of gold; in the east the
groves and dancing-ground of the sun; in the
south the country of the blameless Ethiopians, whither
the gods were wont to resort. In the Mediterranean
itself the Sirens beguiled the passers-by with their songs
near where Naples now stands; adjoining were Scylla and
Charybdis; in Sicily were the one-eyed Cyclops and
cannibal Læstrygons. In the island of Erytheia the
three-headed giant Geryon tended his oxen with a double-headed
dog. I need not speak of the lotus-eaters, whose
food made one forget his native country; of the floating
island of Æolus; of the happy fields in which the horses
of the sun were grazing; of bulls and dogs of immortal
breed; of hydras, gorgons, and chimeras; of the flying
man Dædalus, and the brazen chamber in which Danae
was kept. There was no river, no grotto that had not its
genius; no island, no promontory without its legend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earliest Greek
theological
ideas indicate
a savage state.</div>

<p>It is impossible to recall these antique myths without
being satisfied that they are, for the most part, truly
indigenous, truly of European growth. The seed may
have been brought, as comparative philologists assert, from
Asia, but it had luxuriantly germinated and developed
under the sky of Europe. Of the legends, many are far
from answering to their reputed Oriental source; their
barbarism and indelicacy represent the state of
Europe. The outrage of Kronos on his father
Uranos speaks of the savagism of the times;
the story of Dionysos tells of man-stealing and
piracy; the rapes of Europa and Helen, of the abduction
of women. The dinner at which Itys was served
up assures us that cannibalism was practised; the
threat of Laomedon that he would sell Poseidon and
Apollo for slaves shows how compulsory labour might be
obtained. The polygamy of many heroes often appears in
its worst form under the practice of sister-marriage, a
crime indulged in from the King of Olympus downward.
Upon the whole, then, we must admit that Greek mythology
indicates a barbarian social state, man-stealing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
piracy, human sacrifice, polygamy, cannibalism, and crimes
of revenge that are unmentionable. A personal interpretation,
such as man in his infancy resorts to, is embodied
in circumstances suitable to a savage time. It was
not until a later period that allegorical phantasms, such
as Death, and Sleep, and Dreams were introduced, and
still later when the whole system was affected by Lydian,
Phrygian, Assyrian, and Egyptian ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their gradual
improvement
in the historic
times.</div>

<p>Not only thus from their intrinsic nature, but also from
their recorded gradual development, are we warranted in
imputing to the greater part of the myths an
indigenous origin. The theogony of Homer is
extended by Hesiod in many essential points.
He prefixes the dynasty of Uranos, and differs
in minor conceptions, as in the character of the Cyclops.
The Orphic theogony is again another advance, having
new fictions and new personages, as in the case of
Zagreus, the horned child of Jupiter by his own daughter
Persephone. Indeed, there is hardly one of the great and
venerable gods of Olympus whose character does not
change with his age, and, seen from this point of view,
the origin of the Ionic philosophy becomes a necessary
step in the advance. That philosophy, as we
shall soon find, was due not only to the expansion
of the Greek intellect and the necessary
<span class="sidenote">The inevitable tendency is to
the Ionic philosophy.</span>
improvement of Greek morals; an extraneous
cause, the sudden opening of the Egyptian ports, 670 <small>B.C.</small>,
accelerated it. European religion became more mysterious
and more solemn. European philosophy learned the
error of its chronology, and the necessity of applying
a more strict and correct standard of evidence for ancient
events.</p>

<p>It was an ominous circumstance that the Ionian Greeks,
who first began to philosophize, commenced their labours
by depersonifying the elements, and treating not of Zeus,
Poseidon, and Hades, but of Air, Water, Fire. The
destruction of theological conceptions led irresistibly to
the destruction of religious practices. To divinities
whose existence he denied, the philosopher ceased to
pray. Of what use were sacrificial offerings and entreaties
directed to phantasms of the imagination? but advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
might accrue from the physical study of the impersonal
elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inevitable
destruction of
Greek religious
ideas</div>

<p>Greek religion contained within itself the principles of
its own destruction. It is for the sake of thoroughly
appreciating this that I have been led into a detail of
what some of my readers may be disposed to
regard as idle and useless myths. Two circumstances
of inevitable occurrence insured the
eventual overthrow of the whole system; they
were geographical discovery and the rise of philosophical
criticism. Our attention is riveted by the fact that, two
thousand years later, the same thing again occurred on a
greater scale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">by geographical
discovery.</div>

<p>As to the geographical discovery, how was it possible
that all the marvels of the Mediterranean and
Black Seas, the sorcerers, enchanters, giants,
and monsters of the deep, should survive when those seas
were daily crossed in all directions? How was it possible
that the notion of a flat earth, bounded by the horizon
and bordered by the circumfluous ocean, could maintain
itself when colonies were being founded in Gaul, and
the Ph&oelig;nicians were bringing tin from beyond the
Pillars of Hercules? Moreover, it so happened that many
of the most astounding prodigies were affirmed to be in
the track which circumstances had now made the chief
pathway of commerce. Not only was there a certainty of
the destruction of mythical geography as thus presented
on the plane of the earth looking upward to day; there
was also an imminent risk, as many pious persons foresaw
and dreaded, that what had been asserted as respects the
interior, or the other face looking downward into night,
would be involved in the ruin too. Well, therefore, might
they make the struggle they did for the support of the
ancient doctrine, taking the only course possible to them,
of converting what had been affirmed to be actual events
into allegories, under which, they said, the wisdom of
ancient times had concealed many sacred and mysterious
things. But it is apparent that a system forced to this
necessity is fast hastening to its end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fictitious
marvels replaced
by
grand actualities.</div>

<p>Nor was it maritime discovery only that thus removed
fabulous prodigies and gave rise to new ideas. In due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
course of time the Macedonian expedition opened a new
world to the Greeks and presented them with real wonders;
climates in marvellous diversity, vast deserts,
mountains covered with eternal snow, salt seas
far from the ocean, colossal animals, and men of
every shade of colour and every form of religion.
The numerous Greek colonies founded all over Asia gave
rise to an incessant locomotion, and caused these natural
objects to make a profound and permanent impression on
the Hellenic mind. If through the Bactrian empire
European ideas were transmitted to the far East, through
that and other similar channels Asiatic ideas found their
way to Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development
of Mediterranean
commerce.</div>

<p>At the dawn of trustworthy history, the Ph&oelig;nicians were
masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Europe was
altogether barbarous. On the very verge of
Asiatic civilization the Thracians scalped their
enemies and tattooed themselves; at the other
end of the continent the Britons daubed their bodies with
ochre and woad. Contemporaneous Egyptian sculptures
show the Europeans dressed in skins like savages. It
was the instinct of the Ph&oelig;nicians everywhere to establish
themselves on islands and coasts, and thus, for a long time,
they maintained a maritime supremacy. By degrees a
spirit of adventure was engendered among the Greeks.
In 1250 <span class="smcap">B.C</span>. they sailed round the Euxine, giving rise to
the myth of the Argonautic voyage, and creating a
profitable traffic in gold, dried fish, and corn. They had
also become infamous for their freebooting practices.
From every coast they stole men, women, and children,
thereby maintaining a considerable slave-trade, the relic
of which endures to our time in the traffic for Circassian
women. Minos, King of Crete, tried to suppress these
piracies. His attempts to obtain the dominion of the
Mediterranean were imitated in succession by the Lydians,
Thracians, Rhodians, the latter being the inventors of the
first maritime code, subsequently incorporated into Roman
law. The manner in which these and the inhabitants of
other towns and islands supplanted one another shows on
what trifling circumstances the dominion of the eastern
basin depended. Meantime Tyrian seamen stealthily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sailed beyond the Pillars of Hercules, visiting the Canaries
and Azores, and bringing tin from the British Islands.
They used every precaution to keep their secret to themselves.
The adventurous Greeks followed those mysterious
navigators step by step; but in the time of Homer they
were so restricted to the eastern basin that Italy may be
said to have been to them an unknown land. The
Phocæans first explored the western basin; one of their
colonies built Marseilles. At length Coleus of Samos
passed through the frowning gateway of Hercules into
the circumfluous sea, the Atlantic Ocean. No little
interest attaches to the first colonial cities; they dotted
the shores from Sinope to Saguntum, and were at once
trading depôts and foci of wealth. In the earliest times
the merchant was his own captain, and sold his commodities
by auction at the place to which he came. The
primitive and profitable commerce of the Mediterranean
was peculiar&mdash;it was for slaves, mineral products, and
articles of manufacture; for, running coincident with
parallels of latitude, its agricultural products were not
very varied, and the wants of its populations the same.
But tin was brought from the Cassiterides, amber from
the Baltic, and dyed goods and worked metals from Syria.
Wherever these trades centred, the germs of taste and
intelligence were developed; thus the Etruscans, in whose
hands was the amber trade across Germany, have left many
relics of their love of art. Though a mysterious, they
were hardly a gloomy race, as a great modern author has
supposed, if we may judge from their beautiful remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
philosophical
criticism.</div>

<p>Added to the effect of geographical discovery was the
development of philosophical criticism. It is
observed that soon after the first Olympiad the
Greek intellect very rapidly expanded. Whenever
man reaches a certain point in his mental progress,
he will not be satisfied with less than an application of
existing rules to ancient events. Experience has taught
him that the course of the world to-day is the same as it
was yesterday; he unhesitatingly believes that this will
also hold good for to-morrow. He will not bear to
contemplate any break in the mechanism of history; he
will not be satisfied with a mere uninquiring faith, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
insists upon having the same voucher for an old fact that
he requires for one that is new. Before the face of History
Mythology cannot stand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession of
literary men
from the
public faith.</div>

<p>The operation of this principle is seen in all directions
throughout Greek literature after the date that has been
mentioned, and this the more strikingly as the
time is later. The national intellect became
more and more ashamed of the fables it had
believed in its infancy. Of the legends, some are
allegorized, some are modified, some are repudiated. The
great tragedians accept the myths in the aggregate, but
decline them in particulars; some of the poets transform
or allegorize them; some use them ornamentally, as graceful
decorations. It is evident that between the educated
and the vulgar classes a divergence is taking place,
that the best men of the times see the necessity of
either totally abandoning these cherished fictions to the
lower orders, or of gradually replacing them with something
more suitable. Such a frittering away of sacred
things was, however, very far from meeting with public
approbation in Athens itself, although so many people in
that city had reached that state of mental development in
which it was impossible for them to continue to accept the
national faith. They tried to force themselves to believe
that there must be something true in that which had been
believed by so many great and pious men of old, which
had approved itself by lasting so many centuries, and of
which it was by the common people asserted that absolute
demonstration could be given. But it was in vain;
intellect had outgrown faith. They had come into that
condition to which all men are liable&mdash;aware of the fallacy
of their opinions, yet angry that another should remind
them thereof. When the social state no longer permitted
them to take the life of a philosophical offender, they
found means to put upon him such an invisible pressure
as to present him the choice of orthodoxy or beggary.
Thus they disapproved of Euripides permitting his characters
to indulge in any sceptical reflections, and discountenanced
the impiety so obvious in the 'Prometheus Bound'
of Æschylus. It was by appealing to this sentiment that
Aristophanes added no little to the excitement against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Socrates. They who are doubting themselves are often
loudest in public denunciations of a similar state in
others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession of the
philosophers.</div>

<p>If thus the poets, submitting to common sense, had so
rapidly fallen away from the national belief, the philosophers
pursued the same course. It soon became the universal
impression that there was an intrinsic opposition
between philosophy and religion, and herein
public opinion was not mistaken; the fact that polytheism
furnished a religious explanation for every natural event
made it essentially antagonistic to science. It was the
uncontrollable advance of knowledge that overthrew Greek
religion. Socrates himself never hesitated to denounce
physics for that tendency; and the Athenians extended
his principles to his own pursuits, their strong common
sense telling them that the philosophical cultivation of
ethics must be equally bad. He was not loyal to science,
but sought to support his own views by exciting a theological
odium against his competitors&mdash;a crime that
educated men ought never to forgive. In the tragedy that
ensued the Athenians only paid him in his own coin. The
immoralities imputed to the gods were doubtless strongly
calculated to draw the attention of reflecting men, but the
essential nature of the pursuit in which the Ionian and
Italian schools were engaged bore directly on the doctrine
of a providential government of the world. It not only
turned into a fiction the time-honoured dogma of the
omnipresence of the Olympian divinities&mdash;it even struck
at their very existence, by leaving them nothing to do.
For those personifications it introduced impersonal nature
or the elements. Instead of uniting scientific interpretations
to ancient traditions, it modified and moulded the
old traditions to suit the apparent requirements of science.
We shall subsequently see what was the necessary issue of
this&mdash;the Divinity became excluded from the world he had
made, the supernatural merged in natural agency; Zeus
was superseded by the air, Poseidon by the water; and
while some of the philosophers received in silence the
popular legends, as was the case with Socrates, or, like
Plato, regarded it as a patriotic duty to accept the public
faith, others, like Xenophanes, denounced the whole as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
an ancient blunder, converted by time into a national
imposture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antagonism of
science and
polytheism.</div>

<p>As I shall have occasion to speak of Greek philosophy in
a detailed manner, it is unnecessary to enter into other
particulars here. For the present purpose it is
enough to understand that it was radically
opposed to the national faith in all countries
and at all times, from its origin with Thales down to
the latest critic of the Alexandrian school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secession of
historians.</div>

<p>As it was with philosophers, so it was with historians;
the rise of true history brought the same result
as the rise of true philosophy. In this instance
there was added a special circumstance which gave
to the movement no little force. Whatever might be
the feigned facts of the Grecian foretime, they were
altogether outdone in antiquity and wonder by the actual
history of Egypt. What was a pious man like Herodotus
to think when he found that, at the very period he had
supposed a superhuman state of things in his native
country, the ordinary passage of affairs was taking place
on the banks of the Nile? And so indeed it had been for
untold ages. To every one engaged in recording recent
events, it must have been obvious that a chronology
applied where the actors are superhuman is altogether
without basis, and that it is a delusion to transfer the
motives and thoughts of men to those who are not men.
Under such circumstances there is a strong inducement to
decline traditions altogether; for no philosophical mind
will ever be satisfied with different tests for the present
and the past, but will insist that actions and their sequences
were the same in the foretime as now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Universal disbelief
of the
learned.</div>

<p>Thus for many ages stood affairs. One after another,
historians, philosophers, critics, poets, had given up the
national faith, and lived under a pressure perpetually laid
upon them by the public, adopting generally, as their
most convenient course, an outward compliance with the
religious requirements of the state. Herodotus
cannot reconcile the inconsistencies of the Trojan
War with his knowledge of human actions;
Thucydides does not dare to express his disbelief of it;
Eratosthenes sees contradictions between the voyage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Odysseus and the truths of geography; Anaxagoras is
condemned to death for impiety, and only through the
exertions of the chief of the state is his sentence mercifully
commuted to banishment. Plato, seeing things from a very
general point of view, thinks it expedient, upon the whole,
to prohibit the cultivation of the higher branches of physics.
Euripides tries to free himself from the imputation of
heresy as best he may. Æschylus is condemned to be
stoned to death for blasphemy, and is only saved by his
brother Aminias raising his mutilated arm&mdash;he had lost his
hand in the battle of Salamis. Socrates stands his trial, and
has to drink hemlock. Even great statesmen like Pericles
had become entangled in the obnoxious opinions. No one
has anything to say in explanation of the marvellous disappearance
of demigods and heroes, why miracles are
ended, or why human actions alone are now to be seen in
the world. An ignorant public demands the instant punishment
of every suspected man. In their estimation, to
distrust the traditions of the past is to be guilty of treason
to the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts at a
reformation.</div>

<p>But all this confusion and dissent did not arise without
an attempt among well-meaning men at a reformation.
Some, and they were, perhaps, the
most advanced intellectually, wished that the priests should
abstain from working any more miracles; that relics
should be as little used as was consistent with the
psychical demands of the vulgar, and should be gradually
abandoned; that philosophy should no longer be outraged
with the blasphemous anthropomorphisms of the Olympian
deities. Some, less advanced, were disposed to reconcile
all difficulties by regarding the myths as allegorical; some
wished to transform them so as to bring them into harmony
with the existing social state; some would give them
altogether new interpretations. With one, though the
fact of a Trojan War is not to be denied, it was only the
eidolon of Helen whom Paris carried away; with another
expressions, perhaps once intended to represent actual
events, are dwindled into mere forms of speech. Unwilling
to reject the attributes of the Olympian divinities,
their human passions and actions, another asserts that
they must once have all existed as men. While one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
denounces the impudent atheists who find fault with the
myths of the Iliad, ignorant of its allegorical meaning,
another resolves all its heroes into the elements; and still
another, hoping to reconcile to the improved moral sense
of the times the indecencies and wickednesses of the gods,
imputes them all to demons; an idea which found much
favour at first, but became singularly fatal to polytheism
in the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inveterate superstition
of the vulgar.</div>

<p>In apparent inconsistency with this declining state of
belief in the higher classes, the multitude, without
concern, indulged in the most surprising superstitions.
With them it was an age of relics, of
weeping statues, and winking pictures. The
tools with which the Trojan horse was made might still
be seen at Metapontum, the sceptre of Pelops was still
preserved at Chæroneia, the spear of Achilles at Phaselis,
the sword of Memnon at Nicomedia; the Tegeates could
still show the hide of the Calydonian boar, very many
cities boasted their possession of the true palladium from
Troy. There were statues of Athene that could brandish
spears, paintings that could blush, images that could
sweat, and numberless shrines and sanctuaries at which
miracle-cures were performed. Into the hole through
which the deluge of Deucalion receded the Athenians still
poured a customary sacrifice of honey and meal. He
would have been an adventurous man who risked any
observation as to its inadequate size. And though the
<span class="sidenote">Their jealous
intolerance of doubts.</span>
sky had been proved to be only space and stars, and not
the firm floor of Olympus, he who had occasion to refer to
the flight of the gods from mountain tops into
heaven would find it to his advantage to make
no astronomical remark. No adverse allusions
to the poems of Homer, Arctinus, or Lesches were
tolerated; he who perpetrated the blasphemy of depersonifying
the sun went in peril of death. It was not
permitted that natural phenomena should be substituted
for Zeus and Poseidon; whoever was suspected of believing
that Helios and Selene were not gods, would do well
to purge himself to public satisfaction. The people vindicated
their superstition in spite of all geographical and
physical difficulties, and, far from concerning themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with the contradictions which had exerted such an
influence on the thinking classes, practically asserted the
needlessness of any historical evidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slowness of the decline
and fall of Polytheism.</div>

<p>It is altogether erroneous to suppose that polytheism
maintained its ground as a living force until the
period of Constantine and Julian. Its downfall
commenced at the time of the opening of the
Egyptian ports. Nearly a thousand years were
required for its consummation. The change first occurred
among the higher classes, and made its way slowly
through the middle ranks of society. For many centuries
the two agencies&mdash;geographical discovery, arising from
increasing commerce and the Macedonian expedition,
and philosophical criticism&mdash;silently continued their incessant
work, and yet it does not appear that they could
ever produce a change in the lowest and most numerous
division of the social grade. In process of time, a third
influence was added to the preceding two, enabling them
to address themselves even to the humblest rank of life;
<span class="sidenote">The secondary
causes of its downfall.</span>
this influence was the rise of the Roman power.
It produced a wonderful activity all over the
Mediterranean Sea and throughout the adjoining
countries. It insured perpetual movements in all directions.
Where there had been only a single traveller there
were now a thousand legionaries, merchants, government
officials, with their long retinues of dependents and slaves.
Where formerly it was only the historian or philosopher
in his retirement who compared or contrasted the laws
and creeds, habits and customs of different nations
incorrectly reported, now the same things were vividly
brought under the personal observation of multitudes.
The crowd of gods and goddesses congregated in Rome
served only to bring one another into disrepute and
ridicule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The alarm of
good and religious men.</div>

<p>Long, therefore, previous to the triumph of Christianity,
paganism must be considered as having been irretrievably
ruined. Doubtless it was the dreadful social prospect
before them&mdash;the apparent impossibility of preventing
the whole world from falling into a
totally godless state, that not only reconciled so
many great men to give their support to the ancient system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but even to look without disapprobation on that physical
violence to which the uneducated multitude, incapable of
judging, were so often willing to resort. They never
anticipated that any new system could be introduced
which should take the place of the old, worn-out one;
they had no idea that relief in this respect was so close at
hand; unless, perhaps, it might have been Plato,
who, profoundly recognizing that, though it is a
<span class="sidenote">Plato's remedy
for the evil.</span>
hard and tedious process to change radically the
ideas of common men, yet that it is easy to persuade them
to accept new names if they are permitted to retain old
things, proposed that a regenerated system should be
introduced, with ideas and forms suited to the existing
social state, prophetically asserting that the world would
very soon become accustomed to it, and give to it an
implicit adhesion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek
movement has
been repeated
on a greater
scale by all
Europe.</div>

<p>In this description of the origin and decline of Greek
religion I have endeavoured to bring its essential features
into strong relief. Its fall was not sudden, as many have
supposed, neither was it accomplished by extraneous
violence. There was a slow, and, it must be emphatically
added, a spontaneous decline. But, if the affairs of men
pass in recurring cycles&mdash;if the course of events with one
individual has a resemblance to the course of
events with another&mdash;if there be analogies in
the progress of nations, and circumstances reappear
after due periods of time, the succession
of events thus displayed before us in the
intellectual history of Greece may perhaps be recognised
again in grander proportions on the theatre of all Europe.
If there is for the human mind a predetermined order
of development, may we not reasonably expect that the
phenomena we have thus been noticing on a small scale in
a single nation will reappear on the great scale in a
continent; that the philosophical study of this history of
the past will not only serve as an interpretation of many
circumstances in the history of Europe in the Dark and
Middle Ages, but will also be a guide to us in pointing
out future events as respects all mankind? For, though
it is true that the Greek intellectual movement was
anticipated, as respects its completion, by being enveloped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and swallowed up in the slower but more gigantic movements
of the southern European mind, just as a little
expanding circle upon the sea may be obliterated and
borne away by more imposing and impetuous waves, so
even the movement of a continent may be lost in the
movement of a world. It was criticism and physical
discovery, and intellectual activity, arising from political
concentration, that so profoundly affected the modes of
Grecian thought, and criticism and discovery have within
the last four hundred years done the same in all Europe.
To one who forms his expectations of the future from the
history of the past&mdash;who recalls the effect produced by the
establishment of the Roman empire, in permitting free
personal intercommunication among all the Mediterranean
nations, and thereby not only destroying the ancient
forms of thought which for centuries had resisted all
other means of attack, but also replacing them by a homogeneous
idea&mdash;it must be apparent that the wonderfully
increased facilities for locomotion, the inventions of our
own age, are the ominous precursors of a vast philosophical
revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The organization
of hypocrisy.</div>

<p>Between that period during which a nation has been
governed by its imagination and that in which it submits
to reason, there is a melancholy interval. The constitution
of man is such that, for a long time after
he has discovered the incorrectness of the ideas
prevailing around him, he shrinks from openly
emancipating himself from their dominion, and, constrained
by the force of circumstances, he becomes a
hypocrite, publicly applauding what his private judgment
condemns. Where a nation is making this passage,
so universal do these practices become that it may be
truly said hypocrisy is organized. It is possible that
whole communities might be found living in this deplorable
state. Such, I conceive, must have been the case
in many parts of the Roman empire just before the introduction
of Christianity. Even after ideas have given
way in public opinion, their political power may outlive
their intellectual vigour, and produce the disgraceful effect
we here consider.</p>

<p>It is not to be concealed, however, that, to some extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this evil is incident to the position of things. Indeed, it
would be unfortunate if national hypocrisy could not find
a better excuse for itself than in that of the individual. In
civilized life, society is ever under the imperious necessity
of moving onward in legal forms, nor can such forms be
avoided without the most serious disasters ensuing. To
absolve communities too abruptly from the restraints of
ancient ideas is not to give them liberty, but to throw
them into political vagabondism, and hence it is that
great statesmen will authorize and even compel observances
the essential significance of which has disappeared,
and the intellectual basis of which has been
undermined. Truth reaches her full action by degrees,
and not at once; she first operates upon the reason, the
influence being purely intellectual and individual; she
then extends her sphere, exerting a moral control, particularly
through public opinion; at last she gathers for
herself physical and political force. It is in the time
consumed in this gradual passage that organized hypocrisy
prevails. To bring nations to surrender themselves to
new ideas is not the affair of a day.

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this stage of our examination of European intellectual
development, it will be proper to consider briefly two
foreign influences&mdash;Indian and Egyptian&mdash;which affected
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Hindu
philosophy.</div>

<p>From the relations existing between the Hindu and
European families, as described in the preceding chapter,
a comparison of their intellectual progress
presents no little interest. The movement of
the elder branch indicates the path through which the
younger is travelling, and the goal to which it tends. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the advanced condition under which we live we notice
Oriental ideas perpetually emerging in a fragmentary way
from the obscurities of modern metaphysics&mdash;they are the
indications of an intellectual phase through which the
Indo-European mind must pass. And when we consider
the ready manner in which these ideas have been adopted
throughout China and the entire East, we may, perhaps,
extend our conclusion from the Indo-European family to
the entire human race. From this we may also infer how
unphilosophical and vain is the expectation of those who
would attempt to restore the aged populations of Asia to
our state. Their intellectual condition has passed onward,
never more to return. It remains for them only to
advance as far as they may in their own line and to die,
leaving their place to others of a different constitution and
of a renovated blood. In life there is no going back; the
morose old man can never resume the genial confidence of
maturity; the youth can never return to the idle and useless
occupations, the frivolous amusements of boyhood;
even the boy is parted by a long step from the innocent
credulity of the nursery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The phase of
sorcery, and
anthropocentric
phase.</div>

<p>The earlier stages of the comparative theology of India
are now inaccessible. At a time so remote as to be
altogether prehistoric the phase of sorcery had
been passed through. In the most ancient
records remaining the Hindu mind is dealing
with anthropocentric conceptions, not, however,
so much of the physical as of the moral kind. Man had
come to the conclusion that his chief concern is with himself.
"Thou wast alone at the time of thy birth, thou wilt be
alone in the moment of death; alone thou must answer at
the bar of the inexorable Judge."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative
theology advances
in two
directions&mdash;Matter,
Force.<br />
Vedaism contemplates
matter, Buddhism
force.</div>

<p>From this point there are two well-marked steps of
advance. The first reaches the consideration
of material nature; the second, which is very
grandly and severely philosophical, contemplates
the universe under the conceptions of space and
force alone. The former is exemplified in the Vedas and
Institutes of Menu, the latter in Buddhism. In neither of
these stages do the ideas lie idle as mere abstractions; they
introduce a moral plan, and display a constructive power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not equalled even by the Italian papal system. They take
charge not only of the individual, but regulate
society, and show their influence in accomplishing
political organizations, commanding our
attention from their prodigious extent, and
venerable for their antiquity.</p>

<p>I shall, therefore, briefly refer, first, to the older, Vedaism,
and then to its successor, Buddhism.</p>

<p>Among a people possessing many varieties of climate,
and familiar with some of the grandest aspects of Nature&mdash;mountains
the highest upon earth, noble rivers, a vegetation
<span class="sidenote">Vedaism is the adoration of Nature.</span>
incomparably luxuriant, periodical rains, tempestuous
monsoons, it is not surprising that there should have been
an admiration for the material, and a tendency
to the worship of Nature. These spectacles leave
an indelible impression on the thoughts of man,
and, the more cultivated the mind, the more profoundly
are they appreciated.</p>

<p>The Vedas, which are the Hindu Scriptures, and of
which there are four, the Rig, Yagust, Saman and Atharvan,
are asserted to have been revealed by
Brahma. The fourth is, however, rejected by
some authorities and bears internal evidence of
<span class="sidenote">The Vedas and their doctrines.</span>
a later composition, at a time when hierarchical power
had become greatly consolidated. These works are written
in an obsolete Sanscrit, the parent of the more recent
idiom. They constitute the basis of an extensive literature,
Upavedas, Angas, &amp;c., of connected works and commentaries.
For the most part they consist of hymns suitable
for public and private occasions, prayers, precepts, legends,
and dogmas. The Rig, which is the oldest, is composed
chiefly of hymns, the other three of liturgical formulas.
They are of different periods and of various authorship,
internal evidence seeming to indicate that if the later
<span class="sidenote">The Veda doctrine
of God,</span>
were composed by priests, the earlier were the production
of military chieftains. They answer to a state of society
advanced from the nomad to the municipal condition.
They are based upon an acknowledgment of a universal
Spirit pervading all things. Of this God they
therefore necessarily acknowledge the unity:
"There is in truth but one Deity, the Supreme Spirit, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Lord of the universe, whose work is the universe." "The
God above all gods, who created the earth, the
<span class="sidenote">and of the world.</span>
heavens, the waters." The world, thus considered
as an emanation of God, is therefore a part of him;
it is kept in a visible state by his energy, and would
instantly disappear if that energy were for a moment
withdrawn. Even as it is, it is undergoing unceasing
transformations, every thing being in a transitory condition.
The moment a given phase is reached, it is departed
from, or ceases. In these perpetual movements the present
can scarcely be said to have any existence, for as the Past
is ending the Future has begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its transformation.</div>

<p>In such a never-ceasing career all material things are
urged, their forms continually changing, and returning
as it were, through revolving cycles to similar states.
For this reason it is that we may regard our earth, and
the various celestial bodies, as having had a
moment of birth, as having a time of continuance,
in which they are passing onward to an inevitable destruction,
and that after the lapse of countless ages similar
progresses will be made, and similar series of events will
occur again and again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is the visi-semblance
of
God.</div>

<p>But in this doctrine of universal transformation there is
something more than appears at first. The theology of
India is underlaid with Pantheism. "God is One because
he is All." The Vedas, in speaking of the relation
of nature to God, make use of the expression
that he is the Material as well as the Cause of
the universe, "the Clay as well as the Potter." They
convey the idea that while there is a pervading spirit
existing everywhere of the same nature as the soul of
man, though differing from it infinitely in degree, visible
nature is essentially and inseparably connected therewith;
that as in man the body is perpetually undergoing changes,
perpetually decaying and being renewed, or, as in the case
of the whole human species, nations come into existence
and pass away, yet still there continues to exist what may
be termed the universal human mind, so for ever associated
and for ever connected are the material and the spiritual.
And under this aspect we must contemplate the Supreme
Being, not merely as a presiding intellect, but as illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
by the parallel case of man, whose mental principle shows
no tokens except through its connexion with the body;
so matter, or nature, or the visible universe, is to be looked
upon as the corporeal manifestation of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of
mundane
changes.</div>

<p>Secular changes taking place invisible objects, especially
those of an astronomical kind, thus stand as the gigantic
counterparts both as to space and time of the
microscopic changes which we recognize as
occurring in the body of man. However, in
adopting these views of the relations of material nature
and spirit, we must continually bear in mind that matter
"has no essence independent of mental perception; that
existence and perceptibility are convertible terms; that
external appearances and sensations are illusory, and
would vanish into nothing if the divine energy which
alone sustains them were suspended but for a moment."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the soul of
man.</div>

<p>As to the relation between the Supreme Being and man,
the soul is a portion or particle of that all-pervading
principle, the Universal Intellect or
Soul of the World, detached for a while from its primitive
source, and placed in connexion with the bodily frame,
but destined by an inevitable necessity sooner or later to
be restored and rejoined&mdash;as inevitably as rivers run
<span class="sidenote">Its final absorption in God.</span>
back to be lost in the ocean from which they arose.
"That Spirit," says Varuna to his son, "from which all
created beings proceed, in which, having proceeded, they
live, toward which they tend, and in which they
are at last absorbed, that Spirit study to know:
it is the Great One." Since a multitude of moral
considerations assure us of the existence of evil in the world,
and since it is not possible for so holy a thing as the spirit
of man to be exposed thereto without undergoing contamination,
it comes to pass that an unfitness may be contracted
for its rejoining the infinitely pure essence from which it
<span class="sidenote">Of purifying penances,</span>
was derived, and hence arises the necessity of its undergoing
a course of purification. And as the life of
man is often too short to afford the needful opportunity,
and, indeed, its events, in many instances, tend
rather to increase than to diminish the stain, the season
of purification is prolonged by perpetuating a connexion
of the sinful spirit with other forms, and permitting its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
transmigration to other bodies, in which, by the penance
it undergoes, and the trials to which it is exposed,
its iniquity may be washed away, and
satisfactory preparation be made for its absorption
in the ocean of infinite purity. Considering thus the
<span class="sidenote">and transmigration of souls.</span>
relation in which all animated nature stands to us, being
a mechanism for purification, this doctrine of the transmigration
of the soul leads necessarily to other doctrines of
a moral kind, more particularly to a profound respect for
life under every form, human, animal, or insect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The religious
use of animal
life.</div>

<p>The forms of animal life, therefore, furnish a grand
penitential mechanism for man. Such, on these
principles, is their teleological explanation. In
European philosophy there is no equivalent or
counterpart of this view. With us animal life is purposeless.
Hereafter we shall find that in Egypt, though the
doctrine of transmigration must of course have tended to
similar suggestions, it became disturbed in its practical
application by the base fetich notions of the indigenous
African population. Hence the doctrine was cherished by
the learned for philosophical reasons, and by the multitude
for the harmony of its results with their idolatries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of proper
modes of devotion.</div>

<p>From such theological dogmas a religious system obviously
springs having for its object to hasten the purification
of the soul, that it may the more quickly enter on
absolute happiness, which is only to be found in absolute
rest. The methods of shortening its wanderings and bringing
it to repose are the exercises of a pious
life, penance, and prayer, and more especially
a profound contemplation of the existence
and attributes of the Supreme Being. In this profound
contemplation many holy men have passed their lives.</p>

<p>Such is a brief statement of Vedic theology, as exhibited
in the connected doctrines of the Nature of God, Universal
Animation, Transmutation of the World, Emanation of
the Soul, Manifestation of Visible Things, Transmigration,
Absorption, the uses of Penitential Services, and Contemplation
for the attainment of Absolute Happiness in
Absolute Rest. The Vedas also recognize a series of
creatures superior to man, the gods of the elements and
stars; they likewise personify the attributes of the Deity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The three Vedic divinities, Agni, Indra, and Surya, are
<span class="sidenote">Minor Vedic doctrine.</span>
not to be looked upon as existing independently, for all
spirits are comprehended in the Universal Soul.
The later Hindu trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and
Siva, is not recognized by them. They do not authorize
the worship of deified men, nor of images, nor of any
visible forms. They admit the adoration of subordinate
spirits, as those of the planets, or of the demigods who
inhabit the air, the waters, the woods; these demigods
are liable to death. They inculcate universal charity&mdash;charity
even to an enemy: "The tree doth not withdraw
its shade from the woodcutter." Prayers are to be made
thrice a day, morning, noon, evening; fasting is ordained,
and ablution before meals; the sacrificial offerings consist
of flowers, fruits, money. Considered as a whole their
religious tendency is selfish: it puts in prominence the
baser motives, and seeks the gratification of the animal
appetites, as food, pleasure, good fortune. They suggest
no proselyting spirit, but rather adopt the principle that
all religions must be equally acceptable to God, since, if it
were otherwise, he would have instituted a single one,
and, considering his omnipotence, none other could have
possibly prevailed. They contain no authorization of the
division of castes, which probably had arisen in the necessities
of antecedent conquests, but which have imposed a
perpetual obstacle to any social progress, keeping each
class of society in an immovable state, and concentrating
knowledge and power in a hierarchy. Neither in them,
nor, it is affirmed, in the whole Indian literature, is there
a single passage indicating a love of liberty. The Asiatics
cannot understand what value there is in it. They have
balanced Freedom against Security; they have deliberately
preferred the latter, and left the former for Europe
to sigh for. Liberty is alone appreciated in a life of
action; but the life of Asia is essentially passive, its
desire is for tranquillity. Some have affirmed that this
imbecility is due to the fact that that continent has no true
temperate zone, and that thus, for ages, the weak nations
have been in contact with the strong, and therefore the
hopeless aspirations for personal freedom have become extinct.
But nations that are cut off from the sea, or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
have accepted the dogma that to travel upon it is unholy,
can never comprehend liberty. From the general tenor
of the Vedas, it would appear that the condition of women
was not so much restrained as it became in later times,
and that monogamy was the ordinary state. From the
great extent of these works, their various dates and
authorship, it is not easy to deduce from them consistent
principles, and their parts being without any connexion,
complete copies are very scarce. They have undergone
mutilation and restoration, so that great discordances
have arisen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Institutes
of Menu.</div>

<p>In the Institutes of Menu, a code of civil and religious
law, written about the ninth century before
Christ, though, like the Vedas, betraying a
gradual origin, the doctrine of the Divine unity becomes
more distinctly mixed up with Pantheistic ideas. They
present a description of creation, of the nature of God, and
contain prescribed rules for the duty of man in every
station of life from the moment of birth to death. Their
imperious regulations in all these minute details are a
sufficient proof of the great development and paramount
power to which the priesthood had now attained, but
their morality is discreditable. They indicate a high
civilization and demoralization, deal with crimes and a
policy such as are incident to an advanced social condition.
Their arbitrary and all-reaching spirit reminds one of the
papal system; their recommendations to sovereigns, their
authorization of immoralities, recall the state of Italian
society as reflected in the works of Machiavelli. They
hold learning in the most signal esteem, but concede to
the prejudices of the illiterate in a worship of the gods
with burnt-offerings of clarified butter and libations
of the juices of plants. As respects the constitution of
man, they make a distinction between the soul and the vital
principle, asserting that it is the latter only which expiates
sin by transmigration. They divide society into four
castes&mdash;the priests, the military, the industrial, the servile.
They make a Brahmin the chief of all created things, and
order that his life shall be divided into four parts, one to
be spent in abstinence, one in marriage, one as an anchorite,
and one in profound meditation; he may then "quit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
body as a bird leaves the branch of a tree." They vest
the government of society in an absolute monarch, having
seven councillors, who direct the internal administration
by a chain of officials, the revenue being derived from a
share of agricultural products, taxes on commerce, imposts
on shopkeepers, and a service of one day in the month
from labourers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both the
Vedas and
Institutes are
pantheistic.</div>

<p>In their essential principles the Institutes therefore
follow the Vedas, though, as must be the case in every
system intended for men in the various stages of intellectual
progress from the least advanced to the highest, they
show a leaning toward popular delusions. Both
are pantheistic, for both regard the universe as
the manifestation of the Creator; both accept
the doctrine of Emanation, teaching that the
universe lasts only for a definite period of time, and then,
the Divine energy being withdrawn, absorption of everything,
even of the created gods, takes place, and thus, in
great cycles of prodigious duration, many such successive
emanations and absorptions of universe occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disappearance
of the
philosophical
classes, and
consequent
prominence of
anthropocentric
ideas.</div>

<p>The changes that have taken place among the orthodox
in India since the period of the Institutes are in consequence
of the diminution or disappearance of the highly
philosophical classes, and the comparative predominance
of the vulgar. They are stated by
Mr. Elphinstone as a gradual oblivion of monotheism,
the neglect of the worship of some gods
and the introduction of others, the worship of
deified mortals. The doctrine of human deification is
carried to such an extent that Indra and other mythological
gods are said to tremble lest they should be
supplanted by men. This introduction of polytheism and
use of images has probably been connected with the fact
that there have been no temples to the Invisible God, and
the uneducated mind feels the necessity of some recognizable
form. In this manner the Trinitarian conception
of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, with fourteen other chief
gods, has been introduced. Vishnu and Siva are never
mentioned in the Institutes, but they now engross the
public devotions; besides these there are angels, genii,
penates, and lares, like the Roman. Brahma has only one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
temple in all India, and has never been much worshipped.
Chrishna is the great favourite of the women. The doctrine
of incarnation has also become prevalent; the incarnations
of Vishnu are innumerable. The opinion has also been
spread that faith in a particular god is better than contemplation,
ceremonial, or good works. A new ritual,
instead of the Vedas, has come into use, these scriptures
being the eighteen Puranas, composed between the eighth
and sixteenth centuries. They contain theogonies, accounts
of the creation, philosophical speculations, fragmentary
history, and may be brought to support any sectarian
view, having never been intended as one general body,
but they are received as incontrovertible authority. In
former times great efficacy was attached to sacrifice and
religious austerities, but the objects once accomplished in
that way are now compassed by mere faith. In the
Baghavat Gita, the text-book of the modern school, the
sole essential for salvation is dependence on some particular
teacher, which makes up for everything else. The efficacy
which is thus ascribed to faith, and the facility with which
sin may be expiated by penance, have led to great mental
debility and superstition. Force has been added to the
doctrine of a material paradise of trees, flowers, banquets,
hymns; and to a hell, a dismal place of flames, thirst,
torment, and horrid spectres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The philosophical
schools.</div>

<p>If such has been the gradual degradation of religion,
through the suppression or disappearance of the most
highly cultivated minds, the tendency of philosophy is not
less strikingly marked. It is said that even in
ancient times not fewer than six distinct philosophical
schools may be recognized: 1, the prior Mimansa;
2, the later Mimansa, or Vedanta, founded by Vyasa about
1400 <small>B.C.</small> having a Vedanta literature of prodigious
extent; 3, the Logical school, bearing a close resemblance
to that of Aristotle, even in its details; 4, the Atomic
school of Canade; 5, the Atheistical school of Capila; 6,
the Theistical school of Patanjali.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rise of
Buddhism.</div>

<p>This great theological system, enforced by a tyrannical
hierarchy, did not maintain itself without a
conflict. Buddhism arose as its antagonist.
By an inevitable necessity, Vedaism must pass onward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to Buddhism. The prophetic foresight of the great founder
of this system was justified by its prodigious, its unparalleled
and enduring success&mdash;a success that rested on
the assertion of the dogma of the absolute equality of all
men, and this in a country that for ages had been
oppressed by castes. If the Buddhist admits the existence
of God, it is not as a Creator, for matter is equally
eternal; and since it possesses a property of inherent
organization, even if the universe should perish, this
quality would quickly restore it, and carry it on to new
regenerations and new decays without any external agency.
It also is endued with intelligence and consciousness. The
Buddhists agree with the Brahmins in the doctrine of
Quietism, in the care of animal life, in transmigration.
They deny the Vedas and Puranas, have no castes, and,
agreeably to their cardinal principle, draw their priests
from all classes like the European monks. They live in
monasteries, dress in yellow, go barefoot, their heads and
beards being shaved; they have constant services in their
chapels, chanting, incense, and candles; erect monuments
and temples over the relics of holy men. They place an
especial merit in celibacy; renounce all the pleasures of
sense; eat in one hall; receive alms. To do these things
is incident to a certain phase of human progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life of Arddha
Chiddi.</div>

<p>Buddhism arose about the tenth century before Christ,
its founder being Arddha Chiddi, a native of Capila, near
Nepaul. Of his epoch there are, however, many statements.
The Avars, Siamese, and Cingalese fix it <small>B.C.</small> 600;
the Cashmerians, <small>B.C.</small> 1332; the Chinese, Mongols,
and Japanese, <small>B.C.</small> 1000. The Sanscrit
words occurring in Buddhism attest its Hindu origin,
Buddha itself being the Sanscrit for intelligence. After
the system had spread widely in India, it was carried by
missionaries into Ceylon, Tartary, Thibet, China, Japan,
Burmah, and is now professed by a greater portion of the
human race than any other religion. Until quite recently,
the history of Arddha Chiddi and the system he taught
have, notwithstanding their singular interest, been very
imperfectly known in Europe. He was born in affluence
and of a royal family. In his twenty-ninth year he retired
from the world, the pleasures of which he had tasted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and of which he had become weary. The spectacle of a
gangrened corpse first arrested his thoughts. Leaving
his numerous wives, he became a religious mendicant. It
is said that he walked about in a shroud, taken from the
body of a female slave. Profoundly impressed with the
vanity of all human affairs, he devoted himself to philosophical
meditation, by severe self-denial emancipating
himself from all worldly hopes and cares. When a man
has brought himself to this pass he is able to accomplish
great things. For the name by which his parents had
called him he substituted that of Gotama, or "he who kills
the senses," and subsequently Chakia Mouni, or the Penitent
of Chakia. Under the shade of a tree Gotama was
born; under the shade of a tree he overcame the love of
the world and the fear of death; under the shade of a tree
he preached his first sermon in the shroud; under the
shade of a tree he died. In four months after he commenced
his ministry he had five disciples; at the close of
the year they had increased to twelve hundred. In the
twenty-nine centuries that have passed since that time,
they have given rise to sects counting millions of souls,
outnumbering the followers of all other religious teachers.
The system still seems to retain much of its pristine vigour;
yet religions are perishable. There is no country, except
India, which has the same religion now that it had at the
birth of Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The organization
of Buddhism.</div>

<p>Gotama died at the advanced age of eighty years; his
corpse was burnt eight days subsequently. But several
years before this event his system must be considered as
thoroughly established. It shows how little depends upon
the nature of a doctrine, and how much upon effective
organization, that Buddhism, the principles of
which are far above the reach of popular thought,
should have been propagated with so much rapidity,
for it made its converts by preaching, and not, like
Mohammedanism, by the sword. Shortly after Gotama's
death, a council of five hundred ecclesiastics assembled for
the purpose of settling the religion. A century later a
second council met to regulate the monastic institution;
and in <small>B.C.</small> 241, a third council, for the expulsion of fire-worshippers.
Under the auspices of King Asoka, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
character presents singular points of resemblance to that
of the Roman emperor who summoned the Council of
Nicea, for he, too, was the murderer of his own family,
and has been handed down to posterity, because of the
success of the policy of his party, as a great, a virtuous,
and a pious sovereign&mdash;under his auspices missionaries
were sent out in all directions, and monasteries richly
endowed were everywhere established. The singular efficacy
of monastic institutions was rediscovered in Europe
many centuries subsequently.</p>

<p>In proclaiming the equality of all men in this life, the
Buddhists, as we have seen, came into direct collision with
the orthodox creed of India, long carried out into practice
in the institution of castes&mdash;a collision that was embittered
by the abhorrence the Buddhists displayed for any distinction
between the clergy and laity. To be a Brahmin
a man must be born one, but a Buddhist priest might
voluntarily come from any rank&mdash;from the very dregs of
society. In the former system marriage was absolutely
<span class="sidenote">Contest between the Brahmans and Buddhists.</span>
essential to the ecclesiastical caste; in the latter it was
not, for the priestly ranks could be recruited without it.
And hence there followed a most important advantage,
that celibacy and chastity might be extolled as the
greatest of all the virtues. The experience of
Europe, as well as of Asia, has shown how
powerful is the control obtained by the hierarchy
in that way. In India there was, therefore,
no other course for the orthodox than to meet the
danger with bloody persecutions, and in the end, the
Buddhists, expelled from their native seats, were scattered
throughout Eastern Asia. Persecution is the mother of
proselytes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism is founded on the conception of Power or Force.</div>

<p>The fundamental principle of Buddhism is that there is
a supreme power, but no Supreme Being. From
this it might be inferred that they who adopt
such a creed cannot be pantheists, but must be
atheists. It is a rejection of the idea of Being,
an acknowledgment of that of Force. If it admits the
existence of God, it declines him as a Creator. It asserts
an impelling power in the universe, a self-existent and
plastic principle, but not a self-existent, an eternal, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
personal God. It rejects inquiry into first causes as being
unphilosophical, and considers that phenomena
alone can be dealt with by our finite minds.
Not without an air of intellectual majesty, it
tolerates the Asiatic time-consecrated idea of a trinity,
pointing out one not of a corporeal, but of an impersonal
kind. Its trinity is the Past, the Present, the Future.
<span class="sidenote">It does not recognize a personal God,</span>
For the sake of aiding our thoughts, it images the Past
with his hands folded, since he has attained to rest, but
the others with their right hands extended in token of
activity. Since he has no God, the Buddhist cannot
expect absorption; the pantheistic Brahmin looks forward
to the return of his soul to the Supreme Being as a drop
of rain returns to the sea. The Buddhist has no religion,
but only a ceremonial. How can there be a religion where
there is no God?</p>

<div class="sidenote">nor a providential government,</div>

<p>In all this it is plain that the impersonal and immaterial
predominates, and that Gotama is contemplating
the existence of pure Force without
any association of Substance. He necessarily
denies the immediate interposition of any such agency as
Providence, maintaining that the system of nature,
once arising, must proceed irresistibly according to the
laws which brought it into being, and that from this
point of view the universe is merely a gigantic engine.
<span class="sidenote">but refers all
events to resistless law.</span>
To the Brahman priesthood such ideas were particularly
obnoxious; they were hostile to any philosophical system
founded on the principle that the world is
governed by law, for they suspected that its
tendency would be to leave them without any
mediatory functions, and therefore without any claims on
the faithful. Equally does Gotama deny the existence of
chance, saying that that which we call chance is nothing
but the effect of an unknown, unavoidable cause. As to
<span class="sidenote">Doubts the
actual existence of the visible world.</span>
the external world, we cannot tell how far it is a phantasm,
how far a reality, for our senses possess no
trustworthy criterion of truth. They convey to
the mind representations of what we consider to
be external things, by which it is furnished
with materials for its various operations; but, unless it
acts in conjunction with the senses, the operation is lost,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as in that absence which takes place in deep contemplation.
It is owing to our inability to determine what
share these internal and external conditions take in producing
a result that the absolute or actual state of nature
is incomprehensible by us. Nevertheless, conceding to
our mental infirmity the idea of a real existence of visible
nature, we may consider it as offering a succession of
impermanent forms, and as exhibiting an orderly series
of transmutations, innumerable universes in periods of
inconceivable time emerging one after another, and creations
and extinctions of systems of worlds taking place
according to a primordial law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the nature
of man.</div>

<p>Such are his doctrines of a Supreme Force, and of the
origin and progress of the visible world. With like
ability Gotama deals with his inquiry into the
nature of man. With Oriental imagery he bids
us consider what becomes of a grain of salt thrown into
the sea; but, lest we should be deceived herein, he
tells us that there is no such thing as individuality or
personality&mdash;that the Ego is altogether a nonentity. In
these profound considerations he brings to bear his conception
of force, in the light thereof asserting that all
sentient beings are homogeneous. If we fail to follow him
in these exalted thoughts, bound down to material ideas
by the infirmities of the human constitution, and inquire
of him how the spirit of man, which obviously displays so
much energy, can be conceived of as being without form,
without a past, without a future, he demands of us what
has become of the flame of a lamp when it is blown out, or
to tell him in what obscure condition it lay before it was
kindled. Was it a nonentity? Has it been annihilated?
By the aid of such imagery he tries to depict the nature of
existence, and to convey a vivid idea of the metamorphoses
it undergoes. Outward things are to him phantasms; the
impressions they make on the mind are phantasms too.
In this sense he receives the doctrine of transmigration,
conceiving of it very much as we conceive of the accumulation
of heat successively in different things. In one sense
it may be the same heat which occupies such objects one
after another, but in another, since heat is force and
not matter, there can be no such individuality. Viewed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
however, in the less profound way, he is not unwilling to
adopt the doctrine of the transmigration of the
<span class="sidenote">Of transmigration
and penance,</span>
soul through various forms, admitting that there
may accumulate upon it the effect of all those
influences, whether of merit or demerit, of good or of evil,
to which it has been exposed. The vital flame is handed
down from one generation to another, it is communicated
from one animated form to another. He thinks it may
carry with it in these movements the modifications which
may have been impressed on it, and require opportunity
for shaking them off and regaining its original state. At
this point the doctrine of Gotama is assuming the aspect
of a moral system, and is beginning to suggest means of
deliverance from the accumulated evil and consequent
demerit to which the spirit has been exposed. He will
not, however, recognize any vicarious action. Each one
must work out for himself his own salvation, remembering
that death is not necessarily a deliverance from worldly
ills, it may be only a passage to new miseries. But yet,
as the light of the taper must come at last to an end, so
there is at length, though it may be after many transmigrations,
an end of life. That end he calls Nirwana, a
word that has been for nearly three thousand years of
solemn import to countless millions of men;&mdash;Nirwana,
the end of successive existences, that state which has no
relation to matter, or space, or time, to which
<span class="sidenote">and the
passage to nonentity.</span>
the departing flame of the extinguished taper
has gone. It is the supreme end, Nonentity.
The attaining of this is the object to which we ought to
aspire, and for that purpose we should seek to destroy
within ourselves all cleaving to existence, weaning ourselves
from every earthly object, from every earthly
pursuit. We should resort to monastic life, to penance, to
self-denial, self-mortification, and so gradually learn to
sink into perfect quietude or apathy, in imitation of that
state to which we must come at last, and to which, by
such preparation, we may all the more rapidly approach.
The pantheistic Brahman expects absorption in God; the
Buddhist, having no God, expects extinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophical
estimate of
Buddhism.</div>

<p>India has thus given to the world two distinct philosophical
systems: Vedaism, which takes as its resting-point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the existence of matter, and Buddhism, of which
the resting-point is force. The philosophical
ability displayed in the latter is very great;
indeed it may be doubted whether Europe has
produced its metaphysical equivalent. And yet, if I have
correctly presented its principles, it will probably appear
that its primary conception is not altogether consistently
carried out in the development of the details. Great as
was the intellectual ability of its author&mdash;so great as to
extort our profoundest, though it may be reluctant admiration&mdash;there
are nevertheless moments in which it appears
that his movement is becoming wavering and unsteady&mdash;that
he is failing to handle his ponderous weapon with
self-balanced power. This is particularly the case in that
point at which he is passing from the consideration of
pure force to the unavoidable consideration of visible
nature, the actual existence of which he seems to be
obliged to deny. But then I am not sure that I have
caught with precision his exact train of thought, or have
represented his intention with critical correctness. Considering
the extraordinary power he elsewhere displays,
it is more probable that I have failed to follow his
meaning, than that he has been, on the points in question,
incompetent to deal with his task.</p>

<p>The works of Gotama, under the title of "Verbal
Instructions," are published by the Chinese government
in four languages&mdash;Thibetan, Mongol, Mantchou, Chinese&mdash;from
the imperial press at Pekin, in eight hundred large
volumes. They are presented to the Lama monasteries&mdash;a
magnificent gift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Displacement
of its higher
ideas by base
ones.<br />
Its anthropocentric
phase
remains, its
philosophical
declining.</div>

<p>In speaking of Vedaism, I have mentioned the manner
in which its more elevated conceptions were
gradually displaced by those of a base grade
coming into prominence; and here it may be
useful in like manner to speak of the corresponding
debasement of Buddhism. Its practical working
was the introduction of an immense monastic system,
offering many points of resemblance to the subsequent one
of Europe. Since its object was altogether of a personal
kind, the attainment of individual happiness, it was not
possible that it should do otherwise than engender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
extreme selfishness. It impressed on each man to secure
his own salvation, no matter what became of all
others. Of what concern to him were parents,
wife, children, friends, country, so long as he
attained Nirwana!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its legends
and miracles.</div>

<p>Long before Buddhism had been expelled from India
by the victorious Brahmins, it had been overlaid with
popular ornaments. It had its fables, legends,
miracles. Its humble devotees implicitly believed
that Mahamia, the mother of Gotama, an immaculate
virgin, conceived him through a divine influence, and
that thus he was of the nature of God and man conjoined;
that he stood upon his feet and spoke at the moment of
his birth; that at five months of age he sat unsupported
in the air; that at the moment of his conversion he was
attacked by a legion of demons, and that in his penance-fasting
he reduced himself to the allowance of one pepper-pod
a day; that he had been incarnate many times before,
and that on his ascension through the air to heaven he
left his footprint on a mountain in Ceylon; that there is a
paradise of gems, and flowers, and feasts, and music for
the good, and a hell of sulphur, and flames, and torment
for the wicked; that it is lawful to resort to the worship
of images, but that those are in error who deify men, or
pay respect to relics; that there are spirits, and goblins,
and other superhuman forms; that there is a queen of
heaven; that the reading of the Scriptures is in itself an
actual merit, whether its precepts are followed or not;
that prayer may be offered by saying a formula by rote,
or even by turning the handle of a mill from which
invocations written on paper issue forth; that the revealer
of Buddhism is to be regarded as the religious head of the
world.</p>

<p>The reader cannot fail to remark the resemblance of
these ideas to some of those of the Roman Church. When
a knowledge of the Oriental forms of religion was first
brought into Europe, and their real origin was not understood,
it was supposed that this coincidence had arisen
through the labours of Nestorian, or other ancient missionaries
from the West, and hopes were entertained that the
conversion of Eastern Asia would be promoted thereby. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
this expectation was disappointed, and that which many
good men regarded as a preparation for Christianity
proved to be a stumbling-block in its way. It is not
improbable that the pseudo-Christianity of the Chinese
revolters, of which so much has recently been said, is of
the same nature, and will end with the same result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great
diffusion of
Buddhism.</div>

<p>Decorated with these extraneous but popular recommendations,
Buddhism has been embraced by two-fifths of
the human race. It has a prodigious literature, great
temples, many monuments. Its monasteries are
scattered from the north of Tartary almost to
the equinoctial line. In these an education is
imparted not unlike that of the European monasteries
of the Middle Ages. It has been estimated that in
Tartary one-third of the population are Lamas. There
are single convents containing more than two thousand
individuals; the wealth of the country voluntarily pours
into them. Elementary education is more widely diffused
than in Europe: it is rare to meet with a person who
cannot read. Among the priests there are many who are
<span class="sidenote">Its practical
godlessness.</span>
devout, and, as might be expected, many who are impostors.
It is a melancholy fact that, in China, Buddhism
has led the entire population not only into
indifferentism, but into absolute godlessness.
They have come to regard religion as merely a fashion, to
be followed according to one's own taste; that as professed
by the state it is a civil institution necessary for the
holding of office, and demanded by society, but not to be
regarded as of the smallest philosophical importance; that
a man is entitled to indulge his views on these matters
just as he is entitled to indulge his taste in the colour and
fashion of his garments; that he has no more right, however,
to live without some religious profession than he has
a right to go naked. The Chinese cannot comprehend
how there should be animosities arising on matters of
such doubtful nature and trivial concern. The formula
under which they live is: "Religions are many; reason is
one; we are brothers." They smile at the credulity of
the good-natured Tartars, who believe in the wonders of
miracle-workers, for they have miracle-workers who can
perform the most supernatural cures, who can lick red-hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
iron, who can cut open their bowels, and, by passing their
hand over the wound, make themselves whole again&mdash;who
can raise the dead. In China, these miracles, with all
their authentications, have descended to the conjurer, and
are performed for the amusement of children. The
common expressions of that country betray the materialism
and indifferentism of the people, and their consequent immorality.
"The prisons," they say, "are locked night and
day, but they are always full; the temples are always
open, and yet there is nobody in them." Of the dead they
say, with an exquisite refinement of euphemism, "He has
saluted the world." The Lazarist Huc, on whose authority
many of these statements are made, testifies that they die,
indeed, with incomparable tranquillity, just as animals
die; and adds, with a bitter, and yet profoundly true
sarcasm, they are what many in Europe are wanting to be.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From the theology of India I turn, in the next place, to
the civilization of Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egypt a mysterious
country to Europe.</div>

<p>The ancient system of isolation which for many thousand
years had been the policy of Egypt was overthrown
by Psammetichus about <small>B.C.</small> 670. Up to that time the
inhabitants of that country had been shut out from all
Mediterranean or European contact by a rigorous exclusion
exceeding that until recently practised in China and
Japan. As from the inmates of the happy valley, in
Rasselas, no tidings escaped to the outer world, so, to the
European, the valley of the Nile was a region
of mysteries and marvels. At intervals of centuries,
individuals, like Cecrops and Danaus,
had fled to other countries, and had attached the
gratitude of posterity to their memories for the religion,
laws, or other institutions of civilization they had conferred.
The traditions connected with them served only
<span class="sidenote">Its reported wonders.</span>
to magnify those uncertain legends met with all over
Asia Minor, Greece, Italy, Sicily, of the prodigies and
miracles that adventurous pirates reported they
had actually seen in their stealthy visits to
the enchanted valley&mdash;great pyramids covering acres of
land, their tops rising to the heavens, yet each pyramid
nothing more than the tombstone of a king; colossi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sitting on granite thrones, the images of Pharaohs who
lived in the morning of the world, still silently looking
upon the land which thousands of years before they had
ruled; of these, some obedient to the sun, sainted his
approach when touched by his morning rays; obelisks
of prodigious height, carved by superhuman skill from a
single block of stone, and raised by superhuman power
erect on their everlasting pedestals, their faces covered
with mysterious hieroglyphs, a language unknown to the
vulgar, telling by whom and for what they had been constructed;
temples, the massive leaning and lowering walls
of which were supported by countless ranges of statues;
avenues of sphinxes, through the shadows of which, grim
and silent, the portals of fanes might be approached;
catacombs containing the mortal remains of countless
generations, each corpse awaiting, in mysterious embalmment,
a future life; labyrinths of many hundred
chambers and vaults, into which whoso entered without
a clue never again escaped, but in the sameness and
solitude of those endless windings found his sepulchre.
It is impossible for us to appreciate the sentiment of
religious awe with which the Mediterranean people looked
upon the enchanted, the hoary, the civilized monarchy
on the banks of the Nile. As Bunsen says, "Egypt
was to the Greeks a sphinx with an intellectual human
countenance."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its history:
the old empire;
the
Hycksos; the
new empire.</div>

<p>Her solitude, however, had not been altogether unbroken.
After a duration of 1076 years, and
the reign of thirty-eight kings, illustrated by
the production of the most stupendous works
ever accomplished by the hand of man, some of
which, as the Pyramids, remain to our times, the old
empire, which had arisen from the union of the upper
and lower countries, had been overthrown by the Hycksos,
or shepherd kings, a race of Asiatic invaders. These,
in their turn, had held dominion for more than five
centuries, when an insurrection put an end to their
power, and gave birth to the new empire, some of the
monarchs of which, for their great achievements, are still
remembered. In the middle period of this new empire
those events in early Hebrew history took place&mdash;the visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Abram and the elevation of Joseph&mdash;which are related
with such simplicity in the Holy Scriptures. With varied
prosperity, the new empire continued until the time of
Psammetichus, who, in a civil war, having attained
supreme power by the aid of Greek mercenaries, overthrew
<span class="sidenote">Opening of
the Egyptian ports.</span>
the time-honoured policy of all the old dynasties, and
occasioned the first grand impulse in the intellectual
life of Europe by opening the ports of
Egypt, and making that country accessible to
the blue-eyed and red-haired barbarians of the North.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This compels Egypt to
become a maritime state,</div>

<p>It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the influence of this
event upon the progress of Europe. An immense extension
of Greek commerce by the demand for the products of the
Euxine as well as of the Mediterranean was the smallest part
of the advantage. As to Egypt herself, it entailed a complete
change in her policy, domestic and foreign.
In the former respect, the employment of the
mercenaries was the cause of the entire emigration
of the warrior caste, and in the latter
it brought things to such a condition, that, if Egypt
would continue to exist, she must become a maritime
state. Her geographical position for the purposes of
commerce was excellent; with the Red Sea on the east
and the Mediterranean on the north, she was the natural
entrepôt between Asia and Europe, as was shown by the
prosperity of Alexandria in later ages. But there was a
serious difficulty in the way of her becoming a naval
power; no timber suitable for ship-building grew in the
country&mdash;indeed, scarcely enough was to be found to
satisfy the demands for the construction of houses and
coffins for the dead. The early Egyptians, like the
Hindus, had a religious dread of the sea, but their
exclusiveness was, perhaps, not a little dependent on
their want of material for ship-building. Egypt was
therefore compelled to enter on a career of foreign conquest,
<span class="sidenote">and brings on collisions with the Babylonians.</span>
and at all hazards possess herself of the timber-growing
districts of Syria. It was this urgent necessity
which led to her collisions with the Mesopotamian
kings, and drew in its train of consequence
the sieges, sacks, and captivities of Jerusalem,
the metropolis of a little state lying directly between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the contending powers, and alternately disturbed by each.
Of the necessity of this course of policy in the opinion of
the Egyptian kings, we can have no better proof than the
fact that Psammetichus himself continued the siege of
<span class="sidenote">Opening of the Suez Canal.</span>
Azotus for twenty-nine years; that his son Necho reopened
the canal between the Nile at Bubastes
and the Red Sea at Suez&mdash;it was wide enough for
two ships to pass&mdash;and on being resisted therein by the
priests, who feared that it might weaken the country
strategically, attempted the circumnavigation of Africa,
and actually accomplished it. In those times such expeditions
were not undertaken as mere matters of curiosity.
Though this monarch also despatched investigators to
ascertain the sources of the Nile, and determine the causes
of its rise, it was doubtless in the hope of making such
<span class="sidenote">Circumnavigation of Africa.</span>
knowledge of use in a material or economical point of
view, and therefore it may be supposed that the circumnavigation
of Africa was undertaken upon the
anticipated or experienced failure of the advantages
expected to arise from the reopening of the canal;
for the great fleets which Necho and his father had built
could not be advantageously handled unless they could be
transferred as circumstances required, either by the circumnavigation
or by the canal, from one sea to the other.
The time occupied in passing round the continent, which
appears to have been three years, rendered the former
method of little practical use. But the failure experienced,
so far from detracting from the estimation
in which we must hold those kings who could thus
display such a breadth of conception and vigour of
execution, must even enhance it. They resumed the
policy of the conqueror Rameses II., who had many
centuries before possessed the timber-growing countries,
<span class="sidenote">History of the Great Canal.</span>
and whose engineers originally cut the canal from the
Nile to the Red Sea, though the work cost 120,000
lives and countless treasuries of money. The
canal of Rameses, which, in the course of so many centuries,
has become filled up with sand, was thus cleaned
out, as it was again in the reign of the Ptolemies, and
again under the khalifs, and galleys passed from sea to sea.
The Persians, under Darius Hystaspes, also either repaired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it, or, as some say, attempted a new work of the kind;
but their engineering must have been very defective, for
they were obliged to abandon their enterprise after
carrying it as far as the bitter lakes, finding that salt water
would be introduced into the Delta. The Suez mouth of
the canal of Rameses was protected by a system of hydraulic
works, to meet difficulties arising from the variable levels
of the water. It was reserved for the French engineer
Lesseps in the nineteenth century to cut the direct canal
from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, an exploit
which the Pharaohs and Ptolemies had considered to be
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts of
the Asiatics
on the south
Mediterranean
shore.</div>

<p>The Egyptian policy continued by Pharaoh Hophra, who
succeeded in the capture of Sidon, brought on hostilities
with the Babylonian kings, who were now thoroughly
awakened to what was going on in Egypt&mdash;a collision
which occasioned the expulsion of the Egyptians from
Syria, and the seizure of the lower country by Nebuchadnezzar,
who also took vengeance on King Zedekiah for the
assistance Jerusalem had rendered to the Africans in their
projects: that city was razed to the ground,
the eyes of the king put out, and the people
carried captive to Babylon, <small>B.C.</small> 568. It is a
striking exemplification of the manner in which
national policy will endure through changes of dynasties,
that after the overthrow of Babylon by the Medes, and
the transference of power to the Persians, the policy of
controlling the Mediterranean was never for an instant
lost sight of. Attempts were continually made, by operating
alternately on the southern and northern shores, to
push westward. The subsequent history of Rome shows
what would have been the consequences of an uncontrolled
possession of the Mediterranean by a great
<span class="sidenote">Egypt overthrown
by Cambyses.</span>
maritime power. On the occasion of a revolt of
Egypt, the Persian King Cambyses so utterly
crushed and desolated it, that from that day to this, though
twenty-four centuries have intervened, it has never been
able to recover its independence. The Persian advance on
the south shore toward Carthage failed because of the indisposition
of the Ph&oelig;nicians to assist in any operations
against that city. We must particularly remark that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ravaging of Egypt by Cambyses was contemporaneous
with the cultivation of philosophy in the southern Italian

<div class="sidenote">The Fall of
Tyre.</div>

<p>Among the incidents occurring during the struggles
between the Egyptian and Babylonian kings there is one
deserving to be brought into conspicuous prominence,
from the importance of its consequences in European
history. It was the taking of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar.
So long as that city dominated in
the Mediterranean, it was altogether impossible for Greek
maritime power to be developed. The strength of Tyre
is demonstrated by her resistance to the whole Babylonian
power for thirteen years, "until every head was bald and
every shoulder peeled." The place was, in the end, utterly
destroyed. It was made as bare as the top of a rock on
which the fisherman spreads his nets. The blow thus
struck at the heart of Tyrian commerce could not but be
felt at the utmost extremities. "The isles of the sea
were troubled at her departure." It was during this
time that Greece fairly emerged as a Mediterranean naval
power. Nor did the inhabitants of New Tyre ever recover
the ancient position. Their misfortunes had given them
a rival. A re-establishment in an island on the coast was
not a restoration of their supremacy. Carrying out what
Greece instinctively felt to be her national policy, one of
the first acts of Alexander's Asiatic campaign, two hundred
and fifty years subsequently, was the siege of the new
city, and, after almost superhuman exertions, its capture,
by building a mole from the mainland. He literally
levelled the place to the ground; a countless multitude
was massacred, two thousand persons were crucified, and
Tyrian influence disappeared for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
epochs in
Greek history.</div>

<p>In early Greek history there are, therefore, two leading
foreign events: 1st, the opening of the Egyptian
ports, <small>B.C.</small> 670; 2nd, the downfall of Old Tyre,
573. The effect of the first was chiefly intellectual;
that of the second was to permit the commencement
of commercial prosperity and give life to Athens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antiquity of
civilization
and art in
Egypt.</div>

<p>At the dawn of European civilization, Egypt was,
therefore, in process of decadence, gradually becoming less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and less able to resist its own interior causes of destruction,
or the attempts of its Asiatic rivals, who
eventually brought it to ruin. At the first
historical appearance of the country of the Nile
it is hoary and venerable with age. The
beautiful Scripture pictures of the journey of Abram and
Sarai, in the famine, the going down of Joseph, the exodus
of the Israelites, all point to a long-settled system, a
tranquil and prosperous state. Do we ask any proof of
the condition of art to which the Egyptians had attained
at the time of their earliest monuments? The masonry
of the Great Pyramid, built thirty-four hundred years
before Christ, has never yet been surpassed. So accurately
was that wonder of the world planned and
constructed, that at this day the variation of the compass
may actually be determined by the position of its sides;
yet, when Jacob went into Egypt, that pyramid had been
built as many centuries as have intervened from the birth
of Christ to the present day. If we turn from the monuments
to their inscriptions, there are renewed evidences of
antiquity. The hieroglyphic writing had passed through
all its stages of formation; its principles had become
ascertained and settled long before we gain the first
glimpse of it; the decimal and duodecimal systems of
arithmetic were in use; the arts necessary in hydraulic
engineering, massive architecture, and the ascertainment
of the boundaries of land, had reached no insignificant
degree of perfection. Indeed, there would be but very
little exaggeration in affirming that we are practically as
near the early Egyptian ages as was Herodotus himself.
Well might the Egyptian priests say to the earliest Greek
philosophers, "You Greeks are mere children, talkative
and vain; you know nothing at all of the past."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prehistoric
life of Egypt.</div>

<p>Traces of the prehistoric, premonumental life of Egypt
are still preserved in the relics of its language,
and the well-known principles of its religion.
Of the former, many of the words are referable to Indo-Germanic
roots, an indication that the country at an early
period must have been conquered from its indigenous
African possessors by intrusive expeditions from Asia;
and this is supported by the remarkable principles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Egyptian religion. The races of Central Asia had at a
very early time attained to the psychical stage of monotheism.
Africa is only now emerging from the basest
fetichism; the negro priest is still a sorcerer and rain-maker.
The Egyptian religion, as is well known, provided for the
vulgar a suitable worship of complex idolatry, but for
those emancipated from superstition it offered true and
even noble conceptions. The coexistence of these apparent
incompatibilities in the same faith seems incapable of
any other explanation than that of an amalgamation of
two distinct systems, just as occurred again many ages
subsequently under Ptolemy Soter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
Egypt on the
knowledge
and art of
Europe.</div>

<p>As a critical attention is being bestowed by modern
scholars upon Egyptian remains, we learn more
truly what is the place in history of that
venerable country. It is their boast that the
day is not distant when there will be no more
difficulty in translating a page of hieroglyphics than
in translating one of Latin or Greek. Even now,
what a light has been thrown on all branches of ancient
literature, science, art, mythology, domestic life, by researches
which it may be said commenced only yesterday!
From Egypt, it now appears, were derived the prototypes
of the Greek architectural orders, and even their ornaments
and conventional designs; thence came the models of the
Greek and Etruscan vases; thence came many of the
ante-Homeric legends&mdash;the accusation of the dead, the
trial before the judges of hell; the reward and punishment
of every man, from the Pharaoh who had descended from
his throne to the slave who had escaped from his chain;
the dog Cerberus, the Stygian stream, the Lake of
Oblivion, the piece of money, Charon and his boat, the
fields of Aahlu or Elysium, and the islands of the blessed;
thence came the first ritual for the dead, litanies to the
sun, and painted or illuminated missals; thence came the
dogma of a queen of heaven. What other country can
offer such noble and enduring edifices to the gods; temples
with avenues of sphinxes; massive pylons adorned with
obelisks in front, which even imperial Rome and modern
Paris have not thought it beneath them to appropriate;
porticoes and halls of columns, on which were carved the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
portraits of kings and effigies of the gods? On the walls of
the tombs still remain Pthah, the creator, and Neph, the
divine spirit, sitting at the potters wheel, turning clay to
form men; and Athor, who receives the setting sun into
her arms; and Osiris, the judge of the dead. The granite
statues have outlived the gods!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The hieroglyphics.</div>

<p>Moreover, the hieroglyphics furnish intrinsic evidence
that among this people arose the earliest
attempts at the perpetuation and imparting of
ideas by writing. Though doubtless it was in the beginning
a mere picture-writing, like that of the Mexicans, it
had already, at the first moment we meet with it, undergone
a twofold development&mdash;ideographic and phonetic;
the one expressing ideas, the other sounds. Under the
Macedonian kings the hieroglyphics had become restricted
to religious uses, showing conclusively that the old priesthood
had never recovered the terrible blows struck against
it by Cambyses and Ochus. From that time forth they
were less and less known. It is said that one of the
Roman emperors was obliged to offer a reward for the
translation of an obelisk. To the early Christian the
hieroglyphic inscription was an abomination, as full of
the relics of idolatry, and indicating an inspiration of the
devil. He defaced the monuments wherever he could make
them yield; and in many cases has preserved them for us
by plastering them over to hide them from his sight.</p>

<p>In those enigmatical characters an extensive literature
once existed, of which the celebrated books of Hermes
were perhaps a corruption or a relic; a literature embracing
compositions on music, astronomy, cosmogony, geography,
medicine, anatomy, chemistry, magic, and many
other subjects that have amused the curiosity of man.
Yet of those characters the most singular misconceptions
have been entertained almost to our own times. Thus, in
1802, Palin thought that the papyri were the Psalms of
David done into Chinese, Lenoir that they were Hebrew
documents; it was even asserted that the inscriptions in
the temple of Denderah were the 100th Psalm, a pleasant
ecclesiastical conceit, reminding one who has seen in
Egyptian museums old articles of brass and glass, of the
stories delivered down from hand to hand, that brass was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
first made at the burning of Corinth, and glass first discovered
by shipwrecked mariners, who propped their
kettle, while it boiled, on pieces of nitre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antiquity of
the Egyptian
monarchy.</div>

<p>Thousands of years have passed since the foundation of
the first Egyptian dynasty. The Pyramids
have seen the old empire, the Hycksos monarchs,
the New Empire, the Persian, the Macedonian,
the Roman, the Mohammedan. They have stood
while the heavens themselves have changed. They were
already "five hundred years old when the Southern Cross
disappeared from the horizon of the countries of the
Baltic." The pole-star itself is a newcomer to them.
Humboldt, referring to these incidents, remarks that "the
past seems to be visibly nearer to us when we thus connect
its measurement with great and memorable events."
No country has had such a varied history as this birthplace
of European civilization. Through the darkness of
fifty centuries we may not be able to discern the motives
of men, but through periods very much longer we can
demonstrate the conditions of Nature. If nations, in one
sense, depend on the former, in a higher sense they depend
on the latter. It was not without reason that the Egyptians
<span class="sidenote">Causes of the
rise of civilization.</span>
took the lead in Mediterranean civilization.
The geographical structure of their country surpasses
even its hoary monuments in teaching us
the conditions under which that people were placed.
Nature is a surer guide than the traces of man, whose
works are necessarily transitory. The aspect of Egypt
has changed again and again; its structure, since man
has inhabited it, never. The fields have disappeared, but
the land remains.</p>

<p>Why was it that civilization thus rose on the banks of
the Nile, and not upon those of the Danube or Mississippi?
Civilization depends on climate and agriculture. In
Egypt the harvests may ordinarily be foretold and controlled.
Of few other parts of the world can the same be
said. In most countries the cultivation of the soil is
uncertain. From seed-time to harvest, the meteorological
variations are so numerous and great, that no skill can
predict the amount of yearly produce. Without any premonition,
the crops may be cut off by long-continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
droughts, or destroyed by too much rain. Nor is it sufficient
that a requisite amount of water should fall; to
produce the proper effect, it must fall at particular periods.
The labour of the farmer is at the mercy of the winds and
clouds.</p>

<p>With difficulty, therefore, could a civilized state originate
under such circumstances. So long as life is a scene of
uncertainty, the hope of yesterday blighted by the realities
of to day, man is the maker of expedients, but not of laws.
In his solicitude as to his approaching lot, he has neither
time nor desire to raise his eyes to the heavens to watch
and record their phenomena; no leisure to look upon himself,
and consider what and where he is. In the imperious
demand for a present support, he dares not venture on
speculative attempts at ameliorating his state; he is
doomed to be a helpless, isolated, spell-bound savage, or,
if not isolated, the companion of other savages as care-worn
as himself. Under such circumstances, however, if
once the preliminary conditions and momentum of civilization
be imparted to him, the very things which have
hitherto tended to depress him produce an opposite effect.
Instead of remaining in sameness and apathy, the vicissitudes
to which he is now exposed urge him onward; and
thus it is that, though the civilization of Europe depended
for its commencement on the sameness and stability of an
African climate, the conquests of Nature which mark its
more advanced stage have been made in the trying life of
the temperate zone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agriculture
in a rainless
country.</div>

<p>There is a country in which man is not the sport of the
seasons, in which he need have no anxieties
for his future well-being&mdash;a country in which
the sunshines and heats vary very little from
year to year. In the Thebaid heavy rain is said to be a
prodigy. But, at the time when the Dog-star rises with
the sun, the river begins to swell; a tranquil inundation
by degrees covering the land, at once watering and enriching
it. If the Nilometer which measures the height of
the flood indicates eight cubits, the crops will be scanty;
but if it reaches fourteen cubits, there will be a plentiful
harvest. In the spring of the year it may be known how
the fields will be in the autumn. Agriculture is certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in Egypt, and there man first became civilized. The date-tree,
moreover, furnishes to Africa a food almost without
expense. The climate renders it necessary to use, for
the most part, vegetable diet, and but little clothing is
required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rainless
countries of
the West.</div>

<p>The American counterpart of Egypt in this physical condition
is Peru, the coast of which is also a rainless
district. Peru is the Egypt of civilization
of the Western continent. There is also a rainless
strand on the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is an incident
full of meaning in the history of human progress, that, in
regions far apart, civilization thus commenced in rainless
countries.</p>

<p>In Upper Egypt, the cradle of civilization, the influence
of atmospheric water is altogether obliterated, for, in
an agricultural point of view, the country is rainless.
Variable meteorological conditions are there eliminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inundations
of the Nile.</div>

<p>Where the Nile breaks through the mountain gate at
Essouan, it is observed that its waters begin to
rise about the end of the month of May, and in
eight or nine weeks the inundation is at its height. This
flood in the river is due to the great rains which have
fallen in the mountainous countries among which the
Nile takes its rise, and which have been precipitated from
the trade-winds that blow, except where disturbed by the
monsoons, over the vast expanse of the tropical Indian
Ocean. Thus dried, the east wind pursues its solemn
course over the solitudes of Central Africa, a cloudless
and a rainless wind, its track marked by desolation and
deserts. At first the river becomes red, and then green,
because the flood of its great Abyssinian branch, the Blue
Nile, arrives first; but, soon after, that of the White Nile
makes its appearance, and from the overflowing banks not
<span class="sidenote">Gradual rise
of the whole country.</span>
only water, but a rich and fertilizing mud, is discharged.
It is owing to the solid material thus brought
down that the river in countless ages has raised
its own bed, and has embanked itself with
shelving deposits that descend on either side toward the
desert. For this reason it is that the inundation is seen on
the edge of the desert first, and, as the flood rises, the whole
country up to the river itself is laid under water. By the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
middle of September the supply begins to fail and the
waters abate; by the end of October the stream has
returned to its usual limits. The fields are left covered
with a fertile deposit, the maximum quantity of which is
about six inches thick in a hundred years. It is thought
that the bed of the river rises four feet in a thousand
years, and the fertilized land in its width continually
encroaches on the desert. Since the reign of Amenophis
III. it has increased by one-third. He lived <small>B.C.</small> 1430.
There have accumulated round the pedestal of his Colossus
seven feet of mud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geological
age of Egypt.</div>

<p>In the recent examinations made by the orders of the
Viceroy of Egypt, close by the fallen statue of Rameses
II., at Memphis, who reigned, according to
Lepsius, from <small>B.C.</small> 1394 to <small>B.C.</small> 1328, a shaft
was sunk to more than 24 feet. The water which then
infiltrated compelled a resort to boring, which was continued
until 41 feet 4&frac12; inches were reached. The whole
consisted of Nile deposits, alternate layers of loam and
sand of the same composition throughout. From the
greatest depth a fragment of pottery was obtained.
Ninety-five of these borings were made in various places,
but on no occasion was solid rock reached. The organic
remains were all recent; not a trace of an extinct fossil
occurred, but an abundance of the residues of burnt bricks
and pottery. In their examination from Essouan to
Cairo, the French estimated the mud deposit to be five
inches for each century. From an examination of the
results at Heliopolis, Mr. Horner makes it 3·18 inches.
The Colossus of Rameses II. is surrounded by a sediment
nine feet four inches deep, fairly estimated. Its date of
erection was about 3215 years ago, which gives 3&frac12; inches
per century. But beneath it similar layers continue to
the depth of 30 feet, which, at the same rate, would give
13,500 years, to <small>A.D.</small> 1854, at which time the examination
was made. Every precaution seems to have been taken to
obtain accurate results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its geography
and topography.</div>

<p>The extent of surface affected by the inundations of the
Nile is, in a geographical point of view, altogether
insignificant; yet, such as it was, it constituted
Egypt. Commencing at the Cataract of Essouan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at the sacred island of Philæ, on which to this day here
and there the solitary palm-tree looks down, it reached to
the Mediterranean Sea, from 24° 3´ N. to 31° 37´ N. The
river runs in a valley, bounded on one side by the eastern
and on the other by the Libyan chain of mountains, and
of which the average breadth is about seven miles, the
arable land, however, not averaging more than five and a
half. At the widest place it is ten and three-quarters, at
the narrowest two. The entire surface of irrigated and
fertile land in the Delta is 4500 square miles; the arable
land of Egypt, 2255 square miles; and in the Fyoom, 340
square miles, an insignificant surface, yet it supported
seven millions of people.</p>

<p>Here agriculture was so precise that it might almost be
pronounced a mathematical art. The disturbances arising
from atmospheric conditions were eliminated, and the
variations, as connected with the supply of river-water,
ascertained in advance. The priests proclaimed how the
flood stood on the Nilometer, and the husbandman made
corresponding preparations for a scanty or an abundant
harvest.</p>

<p>In such a state of things, it was an obvious step to
improve upon the natural conditions by artificial means;
dykes, and canals, and flood-gates, with other hydraulic
apparatus, would, even in the beginning of society,
unavoidably be suggested, that in one locality the water
might be detained longer; in another, shut off when
there was danger of excess; in another, more abundantly
introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Control of
agriculture by
the government.</div>

<p>There followed, as a consequence of this condition of
things, the establishment of a strong government,
having a direct control over the agriculture
of the state by undertaking and supporting
these artificial improvements, and sustaining
itself by a tax cheerfully paid, and regulated in
amount by the quantity of water supplied from the river
to each estate. Such, indeed, was the fundamental
political system of the country. The first king of the old
empire undertook to turn the river into a new channel he
made for it, a task which might seem to demand very able
engineering, and actually accomplished it. It is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
than five thousand years since Menes lived. There must
have preceded his times many centuries, during which
knowledge and skill had been increasing, before such a
work could even have been contemplated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Topographical
changes occasioned
by the
Nile.</div>

<p>I shall not indulge in any imaginary description of the
manner in which, under such favourable circumstances,
the powers of the human mind were
developed and civilization arose. In inaccessible
security, the inhabitants of this valley were
protected on the west by a burning sandy desert, on the
east by the Red Sea. Nor shall I say anything more of
those remote geological times when the newly-made river
first flowed over a rocky and barren desert on its way to
the Mediterranean Sea; nor how, in the course of ages, it
had by degrees laid down a fertile stratum, embanking
itself in the rich soil it had borne from the tropical
mountains. Yet it is none the less true that such was the
slow construction of Egypt as a habitable country; such
were the gradual steps by which it was fitted to become
the seat of man. The pulse of its life-giving artery makes
but one beat in a year; what, then, are a few hundreds
of centuries in such a process?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inundations
lead to
the study of
astronomy.</div>

<p>The Egyptians had, at an early period, observed that
the rising of the Nile coincided with the
heliacal rising of Sirius, the Dog-star, and hence
they very plausibly referred it to celestial
agencies. Men are ever prone to mistake
coincidences for causes; and thus it came to pass that the
appearance of that star on the horizon at the rising of the
sun was not only viewed as the signal, but as the cause
of the inundations. Its coming to the desired position
might, therefore, be well expected, and it was soon
observed that this took place with regularity at periods of
about 360 days. This was the first determination of the
length of the year. It is worthy of remark, as showing
how astronomy and religious rites were in the beginning
connected, that the priests of the mysterious temple of
Philæ placed before the tomb of Osiris every morning
360 vases of milk, each one commemorating one
day, thus showing that the origin of that rite was in
those remote ages when it was thought that the year was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
360 days long. It was doubtless such circumstances that
led the Egyptians to the cultivation of historical habits.
In this they differed from the Hindus, who kept no
records.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The philosophy
of star-worship.</div>

<p>The Dog-star Sirius is the most splendid star in the
heavens; to the Egyptian the inundation was
the most important event upon earth. Mistaking
a coincidence for a cause, he was led to
the belief that when that brilliant star emerged in the
morning from the rays of the sun, and began to assert its
own inherent power, the sympathetic river, moved thereby,
commenced to rise. A false inference like this soon
dilated into a general doctrine; for if one star could in
this way manifest a direct control over the course of
terrestrial affairs, why should not another&mdash;indeed, why
should not all? Moreover, it could not have escaped
notice that the daily tides of the Red Sea are connected
with the movements and position of the sun and moon,
following those luminaries in the time of their occurrence,
and being determined by their respective position as
to amount at spring and at neap. But the necessary
result of such a view is no other than the admission of the
astrological influence of the heavenly bodies; first, as
respects inanimate nature, and then as respects the
fortune and fate of men. It is not until the vast distance
of the starry bodies is suspected that man begins to feel
the necessity of a mediator between him and them, and
star-worship passes to its second phase.</p>

<p>To what part of the world could the Egyptian travel
without seeing in the skies the same constellations? Far
from the banks of the Nile, in the western deserts, in
Syria, in Arabia, the stars are the same. They are
omnipresent; for we may lose sight of the things of the
earth, but not of those of the heavens. The air of fate-like
precision with which their appointed movements are
accomplished, their solemn silence, their incomprehensible
distances, might satisfy an observer that they are far
removed from the influences of all human power, though,
perhaps, they may be invoked by human prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Principles of
Egyptian
theology.</div>

<p>Thus star-worship found for itself a plausible justification.
The Egyptian system, at its highest development,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
combined the adoration of the heavenly bodies&mdash;the sun,
the moon, Venus, &amp;c., with the deified attributes
of God. The great and venerable divinities,
as Osiris, Pthah, Amun, were impersonations of
such attributes, just as we speak of the Creator, the
Almighty. It was held that not only has God never
appeared upon earth in the human form, but that such
is altogether an impossibility, since he is the animating
principle of the entire universe, visible nature being only
a manifestation of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God.
Trinities and
their persons.</div>

<p>These impersonated attributes were arranged in various
trinities, in each of which the third member is a
procession from the other two, the doctrine and
even expressions in this respect being full of
interest to one who studies the gradual development of
comparative theology in Europe. Thus from Amun by
Maut proceeds Khonso, from Osiris by Isis proceeds Horus,
from Neph by Saté proceeds Anouké. While, therefore,
it was considered unlawful to represent God except by his
attributes, these trinities and their persons offered abundant
means of idolatrous worship for the vulgar. It was
admitted that there had been terrestrial manifestations of
these divine attributes for the salvation of men. Thus
Osiris was incarnate in the flesh: he fell a sacrifice to the
evil principle, and, after his death and resurrection,
became the appointed judge of the dead. In his capacity
of President of the West, or of the region of the setting
stars, he dwells in the under world, which is traversed by
the sun at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incarnations;
fall of man;
redemption.</div>

<p>The Egyptian priests affirmed that nothing is ever
annihilated; to die is therefore only to assume a new
form. Herodotus says that they were the first to discover
that the soul is immortal, their conception of it being
that it is an emanation from or a particle of the universal
soul, which in a less degree animates all animals and
plants, and even inorganic things. Their dogma that
there had been divine incarnations obliged
them to assert that there had been a fall of
man, this seeming to be necessary to obtain a
logical argument in justification of prodigies so great.
For the relief of the guilty soul, they prescribed in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
life fasts and penances, and in the future a transmigration
<span class="sidenote">The future judgment.</span>
through animals for purification. At death, the merits of
the soul were ascertained by a formal trial
before Osiris in the shadowy region of Amenti&mdash;the
under world&mdash;in presence of the four genii of that
realm, and of forty-two assessors. To this judgment the
shade was conducted by Horus, who carried him past
Cerberus, a hippopotamus, the gaunt guardian of the gate.
He stood by in silence while Anubis weighed his heart in
the scales of justice. If his good works preponderated, he
was dismissed to the fields of Aahlu&mdash;the Elysian Fields;
if his evil, he was condemned to transmigration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The trial of
the dead.</div>

<p>But that this doctrine of a judgment in another world
might not decline into an idle legend, it was enforced by
a preparatory trial in this&mdash;a trial of fearful and living
import. From the sovereign to the meanest subject, every
man underwent a sepulchral inquisition. As
soon as any one died, his body was sent to the
embalmers, who kept it forty days, and for thirty-two
in addition the family mourned, the mummy, in its coffin,
was placed erect in an inner chamber of the house. Notice
was then sent to the forty-two assessors of the district;
and on an appointed day, the corpse was carried to the
sacred lake, of which every nome, and, indeed, every large
town, had one toward the west. Arrived on its shore, the
trial commenced; any person might bring charges against
the deceased, or speak in his behalf; but woe to the false
accuser. The assessors then passed sentence according to
the evidence before them: if they found an evil life,
sepulture was denied, and, in the midst of social disgrace,
the friends bore back the mummy to their home, to be
redeemed by their own good works in future years; or, if
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the Greek Hades.</span>
too poor to give it a place of refuge, it was buried on the
margin of the lake, the culprit ghost waiting
and wandering for a hundred years. On these
Stygian shores the bones of some are still dug up in our
day: they have remained unsepulchred for more than
thirty times their predestined century. Even to wicked
kings a burial had thus been denied. But, if the verdict
of the assessors was favourable, a coin was paid to the
boatman Charon for ferriage; a cake was provided for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hippopotamus Cerberus; they rowed across the lake in the
baris, or death-boat, the priest announcing to Osiris and
the unearthly assessors the good deeds of the deceased.
Arriving on the opposite shore, the procession walked in
solemn silence, and the mummy was then deposited in its
final resting-place&mdash;the catacombs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ceremonies,
creeds,
oracles,
prophecy.</div>

<p>From this it may be gathered that the Egyptian religion
did not remain a mere speculative subject, but was
enforced on the people by the most solemn ceremonies.
Moreover, in the great temples, grand processional
services were celebrated, the precursors
of some that still endure. There were sacrifices
of meat-offerings, libations, incense. The national
double creed, adapted in one branch to the vulgar,
in the other to the learned, necessarily implied mysteries;
some of these were avowedly transported to Greece. The
machinery of oracles was resorted to. The Greek oracles
were of Egyptian origin. So profound was the respect
paid to their commands that even the sovereigns were
obliged to obey them. It was thus that a warning from
the oracle of Amun caused Necho to stop the construction
of his canal. For the determination of future events,
omens were studied, entrails inspected, and nativities were
cast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
Greek philosophy.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Chapter II. I have described the origin and decline of
Greek Mythology; in this, I am to relate the
first European attempt at philosophizing. The
Ionian systems spring directly out of the contemporary
religious opinions, and appear as a phase in
Greek comparative theology.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the psychical condition of India, we
cannot but be struck with the feebleness of these first
European efforts. They correspond to that period in
which the mind has shaken off its ideas of sorcery, but
has not advanced beyond geocentral and anthropocentral
conceptions. As is uniformly observed, as soon as man has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Its imperfections.</span>
collected what he considers to be trustworthy data, he forthwith
applies them to a cosmogony, and develops
pseudo-scientific systems. It is not until a later
period that he awakens to the suspicion that we have no
absolute knowledge of truth.</p>

<p>The reader, who might, perhaps, be repelled by the
apparent worthlessness of the succession of Greek opinions
now to be described, will find them assume an interest, if
considered in the aggregate, or viewed as a series of steps
or stages of European approach to conclusions long before
arrived at in Egypt and India. Far in advance of anything
that Greece can offer, the intellectual history of
India furnishes systems at once consistent and imposing&mdash;systems
not remaining useless speculations, but becoming
inwoven in social life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commences
in Asia Minor.</div>

<p>Greek philosophy is considered as having originated
with Thales, who, though of Ph&oelig;nician descent,
was born at Miletus, a Greek colony in Asia
Minor, about <small>B.C.</small> 640. At that time, as related in the last
chapter, the Egyptian ports had been opened to foreigners
by Psammetichus. In the civil war which that monarch
had been waging with his colleagues, he owed his success
to Ionian and other Greek mercenaries whom he had
employed; but, though proving victor in the contest, his
political position was such as to compel him to depart
from the maxims followed in his country for so many
thousand years, and to permit foreigners to have access to
it. Hitherto the Europeans had been only known to the
Egyptians as pirates and cannibals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of
Thales<br />
is derived
from Egypt.</div>

<p>From the doctrine of Thales, it may be inferred that,
though he had visited Egypt, he had never been
in communication with its sources of learning,
but had merely mingled among the vulgar, from whom he
had gathered the popular notion that the first principle is
water. The state of things in Egypt suggests
that this primitive dogma of European philosophy
was a popular notion in that country. With but
little care on the part of men the fertilizing Nile-water
yielded those abundant crops which made Egypt the
granary of the Old World. It might therefore be said,
both philosophically and facetiously, that the first principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Importance of water in Egypt.</span>
of all things is water. The harvests depended on it, and,
through them, animals and man. The government
of the country was supported by it, for
the financial system was founded on a tax paid by the
proprietors of the land for the use of the public sluices
and aqueducts. There was not a peasant to whom it was
not apparent that water is the first principle of all things,
even of taxation; and, since it was not only necessary to
survey lands to ascertain the surface that had been
irrigated, but to redetermine their boundaries after the
subsidence of the flood, even the scribes and surveyors
might concede that geometry itself was indebted for its
origin to water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thales asserts
that water is
the first
principle.</div>

<p>If, therefore, in any part of the Old World, this doctrine
had both a vulgar and a philosophical significance, that
country was Egypt. We may picture to ourselves the
inquisitive but ill-instructed Thales carried in some pirate-ship
or trading-bark to the mysterious Nile, respecting
which Ionia was full of legends and myths. He saw the
aqueducts, canals, flood-gates, the great Lake M&oelig;ris, dug
by the hand of man as many ages before his day as have
elapsed from his day to ours; he saw on all sides the
adoration paid to the river, for it had actually become
deified; he learned from the vulgar, with whom
alone he came in contact, their universal belief
that all things arise from water&mdash;from the vulgar
alone, for, had he ever been taught by the
priests, we should have found traces in his system of the
doctrines of emanation, transmigration, and absorption,
which were imported into Greece in later times. We may
interpret the story of Thales on the principles which
would apply in the case of some intelligent Indian who
should find his way to the outposts of a civilized country.
Imperfectly acquainted with the language, and coming in
contact with the lower class alone, he might learn their
vulgar philosophy, and carry back the fancied treasure to
his home.</p>

<p>As to the profound meaning which some have been
disposed to extract from the dogma of Thales, we shall,
perhaps, be warranted in rejecting it altogether. It
has been affirmed that he attempted to concentrate all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
supernatural powers in one; to reduce all possible agents
to unity; in short, out of polytheism to bring forth monotheism;
to determine the invariable in the variable; and
to ascertain the beginning of things: that he observed
how infinite is the sea; how necessary moisture is to
growth; nay, even how essential it was to the well-being
of himself; "that without moisture his own body would
not have been what it was, but a dry husk falling to
pieces." Nor can we adopt the opinion that the intention
of Thales was to establish a coincidence between philosophy
and the popular theology as delivered by Hesiod, who
affirms that Oceanus is one of the parent-gods of Nature.
The imputation of irreligion made against him shows at
what an early period the antagonism of polytheism and
scientific inquiry was recognized. But it is possible to
believe that all things are formed out of one primordial
substance, without denying the existence of a creative
power. Or, to use the Indian illustration, the clay may
not be the potter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other doctrines
of Thales.</div>

<p>Thales is said to have predicted the solar eclipse which
terminated a battle between the Medes and Lydians, but
it has been suggestively remarked that it is not stated that
he predicted the day on which it should occur.
He had an idea that warmth originates from or
is nourished by humidity, and that even the sun and stars
derived their aliment out of the sea at the time of their
rising and setting. Indeed, he regarded them as living
beings; obtaining an argument from the phenomena of
amber and the magnet, supposed by him to possess a living
soul, because they have a moving force. Moreover, he
taught that the whole world is an insouled thing, and that
it is full of dæmons. Thales had, therefore, not completely
passed out of the stage of sorcery.</p>

<p>His system obtained importance not only from its own
plausibility, but because it was introduced under favourable
auspices and at a favourable time. It came into Asia
Minor as a portion of the wisdom of Egypt, and therefore
with a prestige sufficient to assure for it an attentive reception.
But this would have been of little avail had not
the mental culture of Ionia been advanced to a degree
suitable for offering to it conditions of development.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Under such circumstances the Egyptian dogma formed the
starting-point for a special method of philosophizing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They constitute
the starting-point
of
Ionian philosophy.</div>

<p>The manner in which that development took place
illustrates the vigour of the Grecian mind. In Egypt a
doctrine might exist for thousands of years, protected
by its mere antiquity from controversy
or even examination, and hence sink with the
lapse of time into an ineffectual and lifeless
state; but the same doctrine brought into a young
community full of activity would quickly be made productive
and yield new results. As seeds taken from the coffins of
mummies, wherein they have been shut up for thousands
of years, when placed under circumstances favourable for
development in a rich soil, and supplied with moisture,
have forthwith, even in our own times, germinated, borne
flowers, and matured new seeds, so the rude philosophy of
Thales passed through a like development. Its tendency is
shown in the attempt it at once made to describe the universe,
even before the parts thereof had been determined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anaximenes
asserts that
air is the first
principle.</div>

<p>But it is not alone the water or ocean that seems to be
infinite, and capable of furnishing a supply for the origin
of all other things. The air, also, appears to reach as far
as the stars. On it, as Anaximenes of Miletus remarks,
"the very earth itself floats like a broad leaf." Accordingly,
this Ionian, stimulated doubtless by
the hope of sharing in or succeeding to the
celebrity that Thales had enjoyed for a century,
proposed to substitute for water, as the primitive
source of things, atmospheric air. And, in truth, there
seem to be reasons for bestowing upon it such a pre-eminence.
To those who have not looked closely into the
matter, it would appear that water itself is generated from
it, as when clouds are formed, and from them rain-drops,
and springs, and fountains, and rivers, and even the sea.
He also attributes infinity to it, a dogma scarcely requiring
any exercise of the imagination, but being rather the
expression of an ostensible fact; for who, when he looks
upward, can discern the boundary of the atmosphere.
<span class="sidenote">It is also the soul.</span>
Anaximenes also held that even the human soul
itself is nothing but air, since life consists in
inhaling and exhaling it, and ceases as soon as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
process stops. He taught also that warmth and cold arise
from mere rarefaction and condensation, and gave as a
proof the fact that when we breathe with the lips drawn
together the air is cold, but it becomes warm when we
breathe through the widely-opened mouth. Hence he
concluded that, with a sufficient rarefaction, air might
turn into fire, and that this probably was the origin of the
sun and stars, blazing comets, and other meteors; but if by
chance it should undergo condensation, it would turn into
wind and clouds, or, if that operation should be still more
increased, into water, snow, hail, and, at last, even into
earth itself. And since it is seen from the results of
<span class="sidenote">The air is God.</span>
breathing that the air is a life-giving principle to man,
nay, even is actually his soul, it would appear to
be a just inference that the infinite air is God
and that the gods and goddesses have sprung from it.</p>

<p>Such was the philosophy of Anaximenes. It was the
beginning of that stimulation of activity by rival schools
which played so distinguished a part in the Greek intellectual
movement. Its superiority over the doctrine of
Thales evidently consists in this, that it not only assigns
a primitive substance, but even undertakes to show by
observation and experiment how others arise from it, and
transformations occur. As to the discovery of the obliquity
of the ecliptic by the aid of a gnomon attributed to Anaximenes,
it was merely a boast of his vainglorious countrymen,
and altogether beyond the scientific grasp of one
who had no more exact idea of the nature of the earth
than that it was "like a broad leaf floating in the air."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diogenes
asserts that
air is the soul
of the world.</div>

<p>The doctrines of Anaximenes received a very important
development in the hands of Diogenes of Apollonia, who
asserted that all things originate from one essence, which,
undergoing continual changes, becoming different at different
times, turns back again to the same state. He
regarded the entire world as a living being, spontaneously
evolving and transforming itself, and
agreed with Anaximenes that the soul of man
is nothing but air, as is also the soul of the
world. From this it follows that the air must be eternal,
imperishable, and endowed with consciousness. "It knows
much; for without reason it would be impossible for all to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be arranged so duly and proportionately as that all should
maintain its fitting measure, winter and summer, night
and day, the rain, the wind, and fair weather; and whatever
object we consider will be found to have been ordered
in the best and most beautiful manner possible." "But
that which has knowledge is that which men call air; it
is it that regulates and governs all, and hence it is the use
of air to pervade all, and to dispose all, and to be in all,
for there is nothing that has not part in it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of
rising above
fetichism.</div>

<p>The early cultivator of philosophy emerges with difficulty
from fetichism. The harmony observed
among the parts of the world is easily explained
on the hypothesis of a spiritual principle residing
in things, and arranging them by its intelligent volition.
It is not at once that he rises to the conception that all
this beauty and harmony are due to the operation of law.
We are so prone to judge of the process of external things
from the modes of our own personal experience, our acts
being determined by the exercise of our wills, that it is
with difficulty we disentangle ourselves from such notions
in the explanation of natural phenomena. Fetichism may
be observed in the infancy of many of the natural sciences.
Thus the electrical power of amber was imputed to a soul
residing in that substance, a similar explanation being also
given of the control of the magnet over iron. The movements
of the planetary bodies, Mercury, Venus, Mars, were
attributed to an intelligent principle residing in each,
<span class="sidenote">Astronomy and chemistry have passed
beyond the fetich stage.</span>
guiding and controlling the motions, and ordering all
things for the best. It was an epoch in the history of the
human mind when astronomy set an example to all other
sciences of shaking off its fetichism, and showing that
the intricate movements of the heavenly bodies
are all capable not only of being explained,
but even foretold, if once was admitted the
existence of a simple, yet universal, invariable,
and eternal law.</p>

<p>Not without difficulty do men perceive that there is nothing
inconsistent between invariable law and endlessly
varying phenomena, and that it is a more noble view
of the government of this world to impute its order to
a penetrating primitive wisdom, which could foresee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
consequences throughout a future eternity, and provide for
them in the original plan at the outset, than to invoke the
perpetual intervention of an ever-acting spiritual agency
for the purpose of warding off misfortunes that might
happen, and setting things to rights. Chemistry furnishes
us with a striking example&mdash;an example very opportune
in the case we are considering&mdash;of the doctrine of Diogenes
of Apollonia, that the air is actually a spiritual being; for,
on the discovery of several of the gases by the earlier experimenters,
they were not only regarded as of a spiritual
nature, but actually received the name under which they
pass to this day, gheist or gas, from a belief that they were
ghosts. If a labourer descended into a well and was suffocated,
as if struck dead by some invisible hand; if a lamp
lowered down burnt for a few moments with a lurid flame,
and was then extinguished; if, in a coal mine, when the
unwary workman exposed a light, on a sudden the place
was filled with flashing flames and thundering explosions,
tearing down the rocks and destroying every living thing
in the way, often, too, without leaving on the dead any
marks of violence; what better explanation could be given
of such catastrophes than to impute them to some supernatural
agent? Nor was there any want, in those times,
of well-authenticated stories of unearthly faces and forms
seen in such solitudes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
psychology.</div>

<p>The modification made by Diogenes in the theory of
Anaximenes, by converting it from a physical
into a psychological system, is important, as
marking the beginning of the special philosophy of
Greece. The investigation of the intellectual development
of the universe led the Greeks to the study of the
intellect itself. In his special doctrine, Diogenes imputed
the changeability of the air to its mobility; a property in
which he thought it excelled all other substances, because
it is among the rarest or thinnest of the elements. It is,
however, said by some, who are disposed to transcendentalize
his doctrine, that he did not mean the common
atmospheric air, but something more attenuated and warm;
and since, in its purest state, it constitutes the most perfect
intellect, inferior degrees of reason must be owing to
an increase of its density and moisture. Upon such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
principle, the whole earth is animated by the breath of life;
the souls of brutes, which differ from one another so
much in intelligence, are only air in its various conditions
of moisture and warmth. He explained the production of
the world through condensation of the earth from air by
cold, the warmth rising upward and forming the sun; in
the stars he thought he recognized the respiratory organs
of the world. From the preponderance of moist air in the
constitution of brutes, he inferred that they are like the
insane, incapable of thought, for thickness of the air
impedes respiration, and therefore quick apprehension.
From the fact that plants have no cavities wherein to
receive the air, and are altogether unintelligent, he was
led to the principle that the thinking power of man arises
from the flowing of that substance throughout the body in
the blood. He also explained the superior intelligence of
men from their breathing a purer air than the beasts,
which carry their nostrils near the ground. In these
crude and puerile speculations we have the beginning of
mental philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern discoveries
as to
the relations
of the air.</div>

<p>I cannot dismiss the system of the Apollonian without
setting in contrast with it the discoveries of
modern science respecting the relations of the
air. Toward the world of life it stands in a position
of wonderful interest. Decomposed into its
constituents by the skill of chemistry, it is no longer
looked upon as a homogeneous body; its ingredients have
not only been separated, but the functions they discharge
have been ascertained. From one of these, carbonic acid,
all the various forms of plants arise; that substance being
decomposed by the rays of the sun, and furnishing to
vegetables carbon, their chief solid ingredient. All those
beautifully diversified organic productions, from the
mosses of the icy regions to the palms characteristic of
the landscapes of the tropics&mdash;all those we cast away as
worthless weeds, and those for the obtaining of which we
<span class="sidenote">Inter-dependence of animals
and plants.</span>
expend the sweat of our brow&mdash;all, without any exception,
are obtained from the atmosphere by the influence
of the sun. And since without plants
the life of animals could not be maintained, they
constitute the means by which the aërial material, vivified,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as it may be said, by the rays of the sun, is conveyed even
into the composition of man himself. As food, they serve
to repair the waste of the body necessarily occasioned in
the acts of moving and thinking. For a time, therefore,
these ingredients, once a part of the structure of plants,
enter as essential constituents in the structure of animals.
Yet it is only in a momentary way, for the essential condition
of animal activity is that there shall be unceasing
interstitial death; not a finger can be lifted without the
waste of muscular material; not a thought arise without
the destruction of cerebral substance. From the animal
system the products of decay are forthwith removed, often
by mechanisms of the most exquisite construction; but
their uses are not ended, for sooner or later they find their
way back again into the air, and again serve for the origination
of plants. It is needless to trace these changes in
all their details; the same order or cycle of progress holds
good for the water, the ammonia; they pass from the
inorganic to the living state, and back to the inorganic
again; now the same particle is found in the air next
aiding in the composition of a plant, then in the body of an
animal, and back in the air once more. In this perpetual
<span class="sidenote">Agency of the sun.</span>
revolution material particles run, the dominating influence
determining and controlling their movement being in
that great centre of our system, the sun. From
him, in the summer days, plants receive, and, as
it were, store up that warmth which, at a subsequent time,
is to reappear in the glow of health of man, or to be rekindled
in the blush of shame, or to consume in the burning
fever. Nor is there any limit of time. The heat we
derive from the combustion of stubble came from the sun
as it were only yesterday; but that with which we
moderate the rigour of winter when we burn anthracite or
bituminous coal was also derived from the same source in
the ultra-tropical climate of the secondary times, perhaps a
thousand centuries ago.</p>

<p>In such perpetually recurring cycles are the movements
of material things accomplished, and all takes place under
the dominion of invariable law. The air is the source
whence all organisms have come; it is the receptacle to
which they all return. Its parts are awakened into life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not by the influence of any terrestrial agency or principle
concealed in itself, as Diogenes supposed, but by a star
which is ninety millions of miles distant, the source,
direct or indirect, of every terrestrial movement, and the
dispenser of light and life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heraclitus asserts
that fire
is the first
principle.</div>

<p>To Thales and Diogenes, whose primordial elements
were water and air respectively, we must add Heraclitus
of Ephesus, who maintained that the first
principle is fire. He illustrated the tendency
which Greek philosophy had already assumed
of opposition to Polytheism and the idolatrous
practices of the age. It is said that in his work, ethical,
political, physical, and theological subjects were so confused,
and so great was the difficulty of understanding his
meaning, that he obtained the surname of "the Obscure."
In this respect he has had among modern metaphysicians
many successors. He founds his system, however, upon
the simple axiom that "all is convertible into fire, and
fire into all." Perhaps by the term fire he understood
what is at present meant by heat, for he expressly says that
<span class="sidenote">The fictitious permanence
of successive forms.</span>
he does not mean flame, but something merely dry and
warm. He considered that this principle is in a state of
perpetual activity, forming and absorbing every
individual thing. He says, "All is, and is not;
for though it does in truth come into being, yet
it forthwith ceases to be." "No one has ever been
twice on the same stream, for different waters are constantly
flowing down. It dissipates its waters and gathers them
again; it approaches and recedes, overflows and fails." And
to teach us that we ourselves are changing and have
changed, he says, "On the same stream we embark and
embark not, we are and we are not." By such illustrations
he implies that life is only an unceasing motion, and we
cannot fail to remark that the Greek turn of thought is fast
following that of the Hindu.</p>

<p>But Heraclitus totally fails to free himself from local
conceptions. He speaks of the motion of the primordial
principle in the upward and downward directions, in the
higher and lower regions. He says that the chief accumulation
thereof is above, and the chief deficiency below:
and hence he regards the soul of a man as a portion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fire migrated from heaven. He carries his ideas of the
transitory nature of all phenomena to their last consequences,
and illustrates the noble doctrine that all which
appears to us to be permanent is only a regulated and
self-renewing concurrence of similar and opposite motions
by such extravagances as that the sun is daily destroyed
and renewed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical and
physiological
doctrines of
Heraclitus.</div>

<p>In the midst of many wild physical statements many
true axioms are delivered. "All is ordered by reason and
intelligence, though all is subject to Fate."
Already he perceived what the metaphysicians
of our own times are illustrating, that "man's
mind can produce no certain knowledge from its
own interior resources alone." He regarded the organs of
sense as being the channels through which the outer life
of the world, and therewith truth, enters into the mind,
and that in sleep, when the organs of sense are closed, we
are shut out from all communion with the surrounding
universal spirit. In his view every thing is animated and
insouled, but to different degrees, organic objects being
most completely or perfectly so. His astronomy may be
anticipated from what has been said respecting the sun,
which he moreover regarded as being scarcely more than a
foot in diameter, and, like all other celestial objects, a
mere meteor. His moral system was altogether based upon
the physical, the fundamental dogma being the excellence
of fire. Thus he accounted for the imbecility of the
drunkard by his having a moist soul, and drew the
inference that a warm or dry soul is the wisest and best;
with justifiable patriotism asserting that the noblest souls
must belong to a climate that is dry, intending thereby to
indicate that Greece is man's fittest and truest country.
There can be no doubt that in Heraclitus there is a strong
tendency to the doctrine of a soul of the world. If the
divinity is undistinguishable from heat, whither can we go
to escape its influences? And in the restless activity and
incessant changes it produces in every thing within our
reach, do we not recognize the tokens of the illimitable
and unshackled?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The puerility
of Ionian
philosophy.</div>

<p>I have lingered on the chief features of the early Greek
philosophy as exhibited in the physical school of Ionia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
They serve to impress upon us its intrinsic imperfection.
It is a mixture of the physical, metaphysical, and mystical
which, upon the whole, has no other value than
this, that it shows how feeble were the beginnings
of our knowledge&mdash;that we commenced with
the importation of a few vulgar errors from Egypt. In
presence of the utilitarian philosophy of that country and
the theology of India, how vain and even childish are
these germs of science in Greece! Yet this very imperfection
is not without its use, since it warns us of the inferior
position in which we stand as respects the time of our
civilization when compared with those ancient states, and
teaches us to reject the assertion which so many European
scholars have wearied themselves in establishing, that
Greece led the way to all human knowledge of any value.
Above all, it impresses upon us more appropriate, because
more humble views of our present attainments and position,
and gives us to understand that other races of men not
only preceded us in intellectual culture, but have equalled,
and perhaps surpassed every thing that we have yet done
in mental philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anaximander's
doctrine of the
Infinite.</div>

<p>Of the other founders of Ionic sects it may be observed
that, though they gave to their doctrines different forms,
the method of reasoning was essentially the same in them
all. Of this a better illustration could not be given than
in the philosophy of Anaximander of Miletus, who was
contemporary with Thales. He started with the
postulate that things arose by separation from
a universal mixture of all: his primordial principle
was therefore chaos, though he veiled it in the metaphysically
obscure designation "The Infinite." The want
of precision in this respect gave rise to much difference of
opinion as to his tenets. To his chaos he imputed an
internal energy, by which its parts spontaneously separated
from each other; to those parts he imputed absolute
unchangeability. He taught that the earth is of a cylindrical
form, its base being one-third of its altitude; it
is retained in the centre of the world by the air in an
equality of distance from all the boundaries of the universe;
that the fixed stars and planets revolved round it, each
being fastened to a crystalline ring; and beyond them, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
like manner, the moon, and, still farther off, the sun. He
<span class="sidenote">Origin of cosmogony.</span>
conceived of an opposition between the central
and circumferential regions, the former being
naturally cold, and the latter hot; indeed, in his opinion,
the settling of the cold parts to the centre, and the
ascending of the hot, gave origin, respectively, to the
formation of the earth and shining celestial bodies, the
latter first existing as a complete shell or sphere, which,
undergoing destruction, broke up into stars. Already we
perceive the tendency of Greek philosophy to shape itself
into systems of cosmogony, founded upon the disturbance
<span class="sidenote">Origin of biology.</span>
of the chaotic matter by heat and cold. Nay, more,
Anaximander explained the origin of living
creatures on like principles, for the sun's heat,
acting upon the primal miry earth, produced filmy
bladders or bubbles, and these, becoming surrounded with
a prickly rind, at length burst open, and, as from an egg,
animals came forth. At first they were ill-formed and
imperfect, but subsequently elaborated and developed. As
to man, so far from being produced in his perfect shape,
he was ejected as a fish, and under that form continued in
the muddy water until he was capable of supporting
himself on dry land. Besides "the Infinite" being thus
the cause of generation, it was also the cause of destruction:
"things must all return whence they came, according to
destiny, for they must all, in order of time, undergo due
penalties and expiations of wrong-doing." This expression
obviously contains a moral consideration, and is an exemplification
of the commencing feeble interconnection between
physical and moral philosophy.</p>

<p>As to the more solid discoveries attributed to this philosopher,
we may dispose of them in the same manner that
we have dealt with the like facts in the biographies of his
predecessors&mdash;they are idle inventions of his vainglorious
countrymen. That he was the first to make maps is
scarcely consistent with the well-known fact that the
Egyptians had cultivated geometry for that express
purpose thirty centuries before he was born. As to his
inventing sun-dials, the shadow had gone back on that of
Ahaz a long time before. In reality, the sun-dial was a
very ancient Oriental invention. And as to his being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
first to make an exact calculation of the size and distance of
the heavenly bodies, it need only be remarked that those
who have so greatly extolled his labours must have overlooked
how incompatible such discoveries are with a
system which assumes that the earth is cylindrical in
shape, and kept in the midst of the heavens by the atmosphere;
that the sun is farther off than the fixed stars;
and that each of the heavenly bodies is made to revolve
by means of a crystalline wheel.</p>

<p>The philosopher whose views we have next to consider
is Anaxagoras of Clazomene, the friend and master of
Pericles, Euripides, and Socrates. Like several of his
predecessors, he had visited Egypt. Among his disciples
were numbered some of the most eminent men of those
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anaxagoras
teaches the
unchangeability
of the
universe.</div>

<p>The fundamental principle of his philosophy was the
recognition of the unchangeability of the universe as a
whole, the variety of forms that we see being
produced by new arrangements of its constituent
parts. Such a doctrine includes, of course, the
idea of the eternity of matter. Anaxagoras says,
"Wrongly do the Greeks suppose that aught begins or
ceases to be, for nothing comes into being or is destroyed,
but all is an aggregation or secretion of pre-existent things,
so that all becoming might more correctly be called becoming-mixed,
and all corruption becoming-separate." In
such a statement we cannot fail to remark that the Greek
is fast passing into the track of the Egyptian and the
Hindu. In some respects his views recall those of the
chaos of Anaximander, as when he says, "Together were
<span class="sidenote">The primal intellect.</span>
all things infinite in number and smallness; nothing was
distinguishable. Before they were sorted, while all was
together, there was no quality noticeable." To
the first moving force which arranged the parts
of things out of the chaos, he gave the designation of "the
Intellect," rejecting Fate as an empty name, and imputing
all things to Reason. He made no distinction between
the Soul and Intellect. His tenets evidently include a
dualism indicated by the moving force and the moved
mass, an opposition between the corporeal and mental.
This indicated that for philosophy there are two separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
routes, the physical and intellectual. While Reason is thus
the prime mover in his philosophy, he likewise employed
many subordinate agents in the government of things&mdash;for
instance, air, water, and fire, being evidently unable to
explain the state of nature in a satisfactory way by the
<span class="sidenote">Cosmogony of Anaxagoras.</span>
operation of the Intellect alone. We recognize
in the details of his system ideas derived from
former ones, such as the settling of the cold and dense
below, and the rising of the warm and light above. In
the beginning the action of Intellect was only partial;
that which was primarily moved was only imperfectly
sorted, and contained in itself the capability of many
separations. From this point his system became a cosmogony,
showing how the elements and fogs, stones,
stars, and the sea, were produced. These explanations, as
mighty be anticipated, have no exactness. Among his
primary elements are many incongruous things, such as
cold, colour, fire, gold, lead, corn, marrow, blood, &amp;c. This
doctrine implied that in compound things there was not a
formation, but an arrangement. It required, therefore,
many elements instead of a single one. Flesh is made of
fleshy particles, bones of bony, gold of golden, lead of
leaden, wood of wooden, &amp;c. These analogous constituents
are hom&oelig;omeriæ. Of an infinite number of kinds, they
composed the infinite all, which is a mixture of them.
From such conditions Anaxagoras proves that all the parts
of an animal body pre-exist in the food, and are merely collected
therefrom. As to the phenomena of life, he explains
it on his doctrine of dualism between mind and matter;
he teaches that sleep is produced by the reaction of the
latter on the former. Even plants he regards as only
rooted animals, motionless, but having sensations and
desires; he imputes the superiority of man to the mere
fact of his having hands. He explains our mental perceptions
upon the hypothesis that we have naturally within
us the contraries of all the qualities of external things;
and that, when we consider an object, we become aware
of the preponderance of those qualities in our mind which
are deficient in it. Hence all sensation is attended with
pain. His doctrine of the production of animals was
founded on the action of the sunlight on the miry earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The earth he places in the centre of the world, whither it
was carried by a whirlwind, the pole being originally in
the zenith; but, when animals issued from the mud, its
position was changed by the Intellect, so that there might
be suitable climates. In some particulars his crude guesses
present amusing anticipations of subsequent discoveries.
Thus he maintained that the moon has mountains, and
valleys like the earth; that there have been grand epochs
in the history of our globe, in which it has been successively
modified by fire and water; that the hills of
Lampsacus would one day be under the sea, if time did
not too soon fail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubts
whether we
have any criterion
of
truth.</div>

<p>As to the nature of human knowledge, Anaxagoras, asserted
that by the Intellect alone do we become
acquainted with the truth, the senses being altogether
untrustworthy. He illustrated this by
putting a drop of coloured liquid into a quantity
of clear water, the eye being unable to recognize any change.
Upon such principles also he asserted that snow is not
white, but black, since it is composed of water, of which
the colour is black; and hence he drew such conclusions
as that "things are to each man according as they seem to
him." It was doubtless the recognition of the unreliability
of the senses that extorted from him the well-known complaint:
"Nothing can be known; nothing can be learned;
nothing can be certain; sense is limited; intellect is weak;
life is short."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anaxagoras is
persecuted.</div>

<p>The biography of Anaxagoras is not without interest.
Born in affluence, he devoted all his means to philosophy,
and in his old age encountered poverty and want. He
was accused by the superstitious Athenian populace of
Atheism and impiety to the gods, since he asserted that
the sun and moon consist of earth and stone, and that the
so-called divine miracles of the times were nothing more
than common natural effects. For these reasons, and also
because of the Magianism of his doctrine&mdash;for he taught
the antagonism of mind and matter, a dogma of the
detested Persians&mdash;he was thrown into prison,
condemned to death, and barely escaped through
the influence of Pericles. He fled to Lampsacus, where he
ended his days in exile. His vainglorious countrymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
however, conferred honour upon his memory in their
customary exaggerated way, boasting that he was the first
to explain the phases of the moon, the nature of solar and
lunar eclipses, that he had the power of foretelling future
events, and had even predicted the fall of a meteoric
stone.</p>

<p>From the biography of Anaxagoras, as well as of several
of his contemporaries and successors, we may learn that a
popular opposition was springing up against philosophy,
not limited to a mere social protest, but carried out into
political injustice. The antagonism between learning and
Polytheism was becoming every day more distinct. Of
the philosophers, some were obliged to flee into exile, some
suffered death. The natural result of such a state of
things was to force them to practise concealment and
mystification, as is strikingly shown in the history of the
Pythagoreans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pythagoras,
biography of.</div>

<p>Of Pythagoras, the founder of this sect, but little is
known with certainty; even the date of his
birth is contested, probably he was born at
Samos about <small>B.C.</small> 540. If we were not expressly told so,
we should recognize from his doctrines that he had been in
Egypt and India. Some eminent scholars, who desire on
all occasions to magnify the learning of ancient Europe,
depreciate as far as they can the universal testimony of
antiquity that such was the origin of the knowledge of
Pythagoras, asserting that the constitution of the Egyptian
priesthood rendered it impossible for a foreigner to become
initiated. They forget that the ancient system of that
country had been totally destroyed in the great revolution
which took place more than a century before those times.
If it were not explicitly stated by the ancients that
Pythagoras lived for twenty-two years in Egypt, there is
sufficient internal evidence in his story to prove that he
had been there a long time. As a connoisseur can detect the
hand of a master by the style of a picture, so one who has
devoted attention to the old systems of thought sees, at a
glance, the Egyptian in the philosophy of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>He passed into Italy during the reign of Tarquin the
Proud, and settled at Crotona, a Greek colonial city on the
Bay of Tarentum. At first he established a school, but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
favoured by local dissensions, he gradually organized from
the youths who availed themselves of his instructions a
secret political society. Already it had passed into a
maxim among the learned Greeks that it is not advantageous
to communicate knowledge too freely to the people&mdash;a
bitter experience in persecutions seemed to demonstrate
that the maxim was founded on truth. The step from a
secret philosophical society to a political conspiracy is but
short. Pythagoras appears to have taken it. The disciples
who were admitted to his scientific secrets after a
period of probation and process of examination constituted
a ready instrument of intrigue against the state, the issue
of which, after a time, appeared in the supplanting of the
ancient senate and the exaltation of Pythagoras and his
club to the administration of government. The actions of
men in all times are determined by similar principles; and
as it would be now with such a conspiracy, so it was then;
for, though the Pythagorean influence spread from Crotona
to other Italian towns, an overwhelming reaction soon set
in, the innovators were driven into exile, their institutions
destroyed, and their founder fell a victim to his enemies.</p>

<p>The organization attempted by the Pythagoreans is an
exception to the general policy of the Greeks. The philosophical
schools had been merely points of reunion for
those entertaining similar opinions; but in the state they
can hardly be regarded as having had any political
existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His miracles.</div>

<p>It is difficult, when the political or religious feelings of
men have been engaged, to ascertain the truth of events in
which they have been concerned; deception, and falsehood,
seem to be licensed. In the midst of the troubles befalling
Italy as the consequence of these Pythagorean machinations,
it is impossible to ascertain facts with certainty.
One party exalts Pythagoras to a superhuman state; it
pictures him majestic and impassive, clothed in robes of
white, with a golden coronet around his brows, listening
to the music of the spheres, or seeking relaxation in the
more humble hymns of Homer, Hesiod, and Thales; lost
in the contemplation of Nature, or rapt in ecstasy in his
meditations on God; manifesting his descent from Apollo
or Hermes by the working of miracles, predicting future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
events, conversing with genii in the solitude of a dark
cavern, and even surpassing the wonder of speaking
simultaneously in different tongues, since it
was established, by the most indisputable testimony, that he
had accomplished the prodigy of being present with and
addressing the people in several different places at the
same time. It seems not to have occurred to his disciples
that such preposterous assertions cannot be sustained by
any evidence whatsoever; and that the stronger and clearer
such evidence is, instead of supporting the fact for which
it is brought forward, it the more serves to shake our confidence
in the truth of man, or impresses on us the conclusion
that he is easily lead to the adoption of falsehood, and
is readily deceived by imposture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His character.</div>

<p>By his opponents he was denounced as a quack, or, at
the best, a visionary mystic, who had deluded
the young with the mummeries of a free-masonry;
had turned the weak-minded into shallow enthusiasts
and grim ascetics; and as having conspired
against a state which had given him an honourable refuge,
and brought disorder and bloodshed upon it. Between
such contradictory statements, it is difficult to determine
how much we should impute to the philosopher and how
much to the trickster. In this uncertainty, the Pythagoreans
reap the fruit of one of their favourite maxims, "Not
unto all should all be made known." Perhaps at the
bottom of these political movements lay the hope of establishing
a central point of union for the numerous Greek
colonies of Italy, which, though they were rich and highly
civilized, were, by reason of their isolation and antagonism,
essentially weak. Could they have been united
in a powerful federation by the aid of some political or
religious bond, they might have exerted a singular influence
on the rising fortunes of Rome, and thereby on
humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pythagoras
asserts that
number is the
first principle.</div>

<p>The fundamental dogma of the Pythagoreans was that
"number is the essence or first principle of
things." This led them at once to the study
of the mysteries of figures and of arithmetical
relations, and plunged them into the wildest fantasies when
it took the absurd form that numbers are actually things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The approval of the doctrines of Pythagoras so generally
expressed was doubtless very much due to the fact that
they supplied an intellectual void. Those who had been
in the foremost ranks of philosophy had come to the
conclusion that, as regard external things, and even ourselves,
we have no criterion of truth; but in the properties
of numbers and their relations, such a criterion does
exist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pythagorean
philosophy.</div>

<p>It would scarcely repay the reader to pursue this system
in its details; a very superficial representation of it is
all that is necessary for our purpose. It recognizes two
species of numbers, the odd and even; and since one, or
unity, must be at once both odd and even, it must be the
very essence of number, and the ground of all other
numbers; hence the meaning of the Pythagorean expression,
"All comes from one;" which also took form in the
mystical allusion, "God embraces all and actuates all, and
is but one." To the number ten extraordinary importance
was imputed, since it contains in itself, or arises from the
addition of, 1, 2, 3, 4&mdash;that is, of even and odd numbers
together; hence it received the name of the grand tetractys,
because it so contains the first four numbers. Some, however,
assert that that designation was imposed on the
number thirty-six. To the triad the Pythagoreans
likewise attached much significance, since it has
a beginning, a middle, and an end. To unity, or one, they
gave the designation of the even-odd, asserting that it
contained the property both of the even and odd, as is
plain from the fact that if one be added to an even number
it becomes odd, but if to an odd number it becomes even.
They arranged the primary elements of nature in a table
of ten contraries, of which the odd and even are one, and
light and darkness another. They said that "the nature
and energy of number may be traced not only in divine
and dæmonish things, but in human works and words
everywhere, and in all works of art and in music." They
even linked their arithmetical views to morality, through
the observation that numbers never lie; that they are
hostile to falsehood; and that, therefore, truth belongs to
their family: their fanciful speculations led them to infer
that in the limitless or infinite, falsehood and envy must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
reign. From similar reasoning, they concluded that the
number one contained not only the perfect, but also the
imperfect; hence it follows that the most good, most
beautiful, and most true are not at the beginning, but that
they are in the process of time evolved. They held that
whatever we know must have had a beginning, a middle,
and an end, of which the beginning and end are the
boundaries or limits; but the middle is unlimited, and, as
a consequence, may be subdivided <i>ad infinitum</i>. They
therefore resolved corporeal existence into points, as is set
forth in their maxim that "all is composed of points or
spacial units, which, taken together, constitute a number."
Such being their ideas of the limiting which constitutes
the extreme, they understood by the unlimited the intermediate
space or interval. By the aid of these intervals
they obtained a conception of space; for, since the units,
or monads, as they were also called, are merely geometrical
points, no number of them could produce a line, but
by the union of monads and intervals conjointly a line
can arise, and also a surface, and also a solid. As to the
interval thus existing between monads, some considered it
as being mere aërial breath, but the orthodox regarded it
as a vacuum; hence we perceive the meaning of their
absurd affirmation that all things are produced by a
vacuum. As it is not to be overlooked that the monads
are merely mathematical points, and have no dimensions
or size, substances actually contain no matter, and are
nothing more than forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pythagorean
cosmogony.</div>

<p>The Pythagoreans applied these principles to account
for the origin of the world, saying that, since its very
existence is an illusion, it could not have any
origin in time, but only seemingly so to human
thought. As to time itself, they regarded it as "existing
only by the distinction of a series of different moments,
which, however, are again restored to unity by the limiting
moments." The diversity of relations we find in the
world they supposed to be occasioned by the bond of harmony.
"Since the principles of things are neither similar
nor congenerous, it is impossible for them to be brought
into order except by the intervention of harmony, whatever
may have been the manner in which it took place. Like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and homogeneous things, indeed, would not have required
harmony; but, as to the dissimilar and unsymmetrical,
such must necessarily be held together by harmony if they
are to be contained in a world of order." In this manner
they confused together the ideas of number and harmony,
regarding the world not only as a combination of contraries,
but as an orderly and harmonical combination thereof.
To particular numbers they therefore imputed great significance,
asserting that "there are seven chords or harmonies,
seven pleiads, seven vowels, and that certain parts
of the bodies of animals change in the course of seven
years." They carried to an extreme the numerical
doctrine, assigning certain numbers as the representatives
of a bird, a horse, a man. This doctrine may be illustrated
<span class="sidenote">Modern Pythagorisms in chemistry.</span>
by facts familiar to chemists, who, in like manner, attach
significant numbers to the names of things. Taking
hydrogen as unity, 6 belongs to carbon, 8 to
oxygen, 16 to sulphur. Carrying those principles
out, there is no substance, elementary or compound,
inorganic or organic, to which an expressive number
does not belong. Nay, even an archetypal form, as of man
or any other such composite structure, may thus possess a
typical number, the sum of the numbers of its constituent
parts. It signifies nothing what interpretation we give
to these numbers, whether we regarded them as atomic
weights, or, declining the idea of atoms, consider them as
the representatives of force. As in the ancient philosophical
doctrine, so in modern science, the number is invariably
connected with the name of a thing, of whatever
description the thing may be.</p>

<p>The grand standard of harmonical relation among the
Pythagoreans was the musical octave. Physical qualities,
such as colour and tone, were supposed to appertain to the
surface of bodies. Of the elements they enumerated five&mdash;earth,
air, fire, water, and ether, connecting therewith the
fact that man has five organs of sense. Of the planets
they numbered five, which, together with the sun, moon,
and earth, are placed apart at distances determined by a
musical law, and in their movements through space give
rise to a sound, the harmony of the spheres, unnoticed by
us because we habitually hear it. They place the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Pythagorean
physics and psychology.</span>
in the centre of the system, round which, with the other
planets, the earth revolves. At this point the
geocentric doctrine is being abandoned and the
heliocentric takes its place. As the circle is the
most perfect of forms, the movements of the planets are
circular. They maintained that the moon is inhabited, and
like the earth, but the people there are taller than men, in
the proportion as the moon's periodic rotation is greater
than that of the earth. They explained the Milky Way as
having been occasioned by the fall of a star, or as having
been formerly the path of the sun. They asserted that the
world is eternal, but the earth is transitory and liable to
change, the universe being in the shape of a sphere. They
held that the soul of man is merely an efflux of the
universal soul, and that it comes into the body from without.
From dreams and the events of sickness they inferred
the existence of good and evil dæmons. They supposed
that souls can exist without the body, leading a kind of
dream-life, and identified the motes in the sunbeam with
them. Their heroes and dæmons were souls not yet become
embodied, or who had ceased to be so. The doctrine of
transmigration which they had adopted was in harmony
with such views, and, if it does not imply the absolute
immortality of the soul, at least asserts its existence after
the death of the body, for the disembodied spirit becomes
incarnate again as soon as it finds a tenement which fits
it. To their life after death the Pythagoreans added a
doctrine of retributive rewards and punishments, and, in
this respect, what has been said of animals forming a
penitential mechanism in the theology of India and Egypt,
holds good for the Pythagoreans too.</p>

<p>Of their system of politics nothing can now with certainty
be affirmed beyond the fact that its prime element
was an aristocracy; of their rule of private life, but little
beyond its including a recommendation of moderation in
all things, the cultivation of friendship, the observance of
faith, and the practice of self-denial, promoted by ascetic
exercises. It was a maxim with them that a right education
is not only of importance to the individual, but also
to the interests of the state. Pythagoras himself, as is
well known, paid much attention to the determination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
extension and gravity, the ratios of musical tones, astronomy,
and medicine. He directed his disciples, in their
orgies or secret worship, to practise gymnastics, dancing,
music. In correspondence with his principle of imparting
to men only such knowledge as they were fitted to receive,
he communicated to those who were less perfectly prepared
exoteric doctrines, reserving the esoteric for the privileged
few who had passed five years in silence, had endured
humiliation, and been purged by self-denial and sacrifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Eleatic
philosophy.</div>

<p>We have now reached the consideration of the Eleatic
philosophy. It differs from the preceding in its neglect of
material things, and its devotion to the supra-sensible.
It derives its name from Elea, a Greek
colonial city of Italy, its chief authors being Xenophanes,
Parmenides, and Zeno.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Xenophanes
represents a
great philosophical
advance.</div>

<p>Xenophanes was a native of Ionia, from which having
been exiled, he appears to have settled at last in Elea, after
leading for many years the life of a wandering rhapsodist.
He gave his doctrines a poetical form for the
purpose of more easily diffusing them. To the
multitude he became conspicuous from his opposition
to Homer, Hesiod, and other popular poets,
whom he denounced for promoting the base polytheism of
the times, and degrading the idea of the divine by the
immoralities they attributed to the gods. He proclaimed
God as an all-powerful Being, existing from eternity, and
without any likeness to man. A strict monotheist, he
denounced the plurality of gods as an inconceivable error,
asserting that of the all-powerful and all-perfect there
could not, in the nature of things, be more than one; for,
if there were only so many as two, those attributes could
not apply to one of them, much less, then, if there were
many. This one principle or power was to him the same as
the universe, the substance of which, having existed from
all eternity, must necessarily be identical with God; for,
since it is impossible that there should be two Omnipresents,
so also it is impossible that there should be two
Eternals. It therefore may be said that there is a tincture
of Orientalism in his ideas, since it would scarcely be
possible to offer a more succinct and luminous exposition of
the pantheism of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He approaches
the Indian
ideas.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
The reader who has been wearied with the frivolities of
the Ionian philosophy, and lost in the mysticisms
of Pythagoras, cannot fail to recognize that here
we have something of a very different kind. To
an Oriental dignity of conception is added an extraordinary
clearness and precision of reasoning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theology of
Xenophanes.</div>

<p>To Xenophanes all revelation is a pure fiction; the
discovery of the invisible is to be made by the intellect
of man alone. The vulgar belief which imputes to the
Deity the sentiments, passions, and crimes of
man, is blasphemous and accursed. He exposes
the impiety of those who would figure the Great Supreme
under the form of a man, telling them that if the ox or
the lion could rise to a conception of the Deity, they
might as well embody him under their own shape; that
the negro represents him with a flat nose and black face;
the Thracian with blue eyes and a ruddy complexion.
"There is but one God; he has no resemblance to the
bodily form of man, nor are his thoughts like ours." He
taught that God is without parts, and throughout alike;
for, if he had parts, some would be ruled by others, and
others would rule, which is impossible, for the very notion
of God implies his perfect and thorough sovereignty.
Throughout he must be Reason, and Intelligence, and
Omnipotence, "ruling the universe without trouble by
Reason and Insight." He conceived that the Supreme
understands by a sensual perception, and not only thinks,
but sees and hears throughout. In a symbolical manner
he represented God as a sphere, like the heavens, which
encompass man and all earthly things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His physical
views.</div>

<p>In his natural philosophy it is said that he adopted the
four elements, Earth, Air, Fire, Water; though by some
it is asserted that, from observing fossil fish, on the tops of
mountains, he was led to the belief that the
earth itself arose from water; and generally,
that the phenomena of nature originate in combinations
of the primary elements. From such views he inferred
that all things are necessarily transitory, and that men,
and even the earth itself, must pass away. As to the
latter, he regarded it as a flat surface, the inferior region
of which extends indefinitely downward, and so gives a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
solid foundation. His physical views he, however, held
with a doubt almost bordering on scepticism: "No mortal
man ever did, or ever shall know God and the universe
thoroughly; for, since error is so spread over all things, it
is impossible for us to be certain even when we utter the
true and the perfect." It seemed to him hopeless that
man could ever ascertain the truth, since he has no other
aid than truthless appearances.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss this imperfect account of Xenophanes,
who was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest of the Greek
philosophers, without an allusion to his denunciation of
Homer, and other poets of his country, because they had
aided in degrading the idea of the Divinity; and also to
his faith in human nature, his rejection of the principle of
concealing truth from the multitude, and his self-devotion
in diffusing it among all at a risk of liberty and life.
He wandered from country to country, withstanding
polytheism to its face, and imparting wisdom in rhapsodies
and hymns, the form, above all others, calculated most
quickly in those times to spread knowledge abroad. To
those who are disposed to depreciate his philosophical conclusions,
it may be remarked that in some of their most
striking features they have been reproduced in modern
times, and I would offer to them a quotation from the
<span class="sidenote">Some of his thoughts
reappear in Newton.</span>
General Scholium at the end of the third book of the
Principia of Newton: "The Supreme God exists
necessarily, and by the same necessity he exists
<i>always</i> and <i>everywhere</i>. Whence, also, he is all
similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all
power to perceive, to understand, and to act, but in a
manner not at all human, not at all corporeal; in a manner
utterly unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of
colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise
God perceives and understands all things. He is utterly
void of all body and bodily figure, and can therefore neither
be seen, nor heard, nor touched, nor ought to be worshipped
under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have
ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of
anything is we know not."</p>

<p>To the Eleatic system thus originating with Xenophanes
is to be attributed the dialectic phase henceforward so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
prominently exhibited by Greek philosophy. It abandoned,
for the most part, the pursuits which had occupied
the Ionians&mdash;the investigation of visible nature,
the phenomena of material things, and the laws presiding
over them; conceiving such to be merely deceptive, and
attaching itself to what seemed to be the only true knowledge&mdash;an
investigation of Being and of God. By the
Eleats, since all change appeared to be an impossibility,
the phenomena of succession presented by the world were
<span class="sidenote">Parmenides on reason and opinion.</span>
regarded as a pure illusion, and they asserted that Time,
and Motion, and Space are phantasms of the imagination,
or vain deceptions of the senses. They therefore separated
reason from opinion, attributing to the former
conceptions of absolute truth, and to the latter
imperfections arising from the fictions of sense.
It was on this principle that Parmenides divided his
work on "Nature" into two books, the first on Reason, the
second on Opinion. Starting from the nature of Being, the
uncreated and unchangeable, he denied altogether the idea
of succession in time, and also the relations of space, and
pronounced change and motion, of whatever kind they
<span class="sidenote">Philosophy becoming Pantheism.</span>
may be, mere illusions of opinion. His pantheism appears
in the declaration that the All is thought and
intelligence; and this, indeed, constitutes the
essential feature of his doctrine, for, by thus
placing thought and being in parallelism with each other,
and interconnecting them by the conception that it is for
the sake of being that thought exists, he showed that they
must necessarily be conceived of as one.</p>

<p>Such profound doctrines occupied the first book of the
poem of Parmenides; in the second he treated of opinion,
which, as we have said, is altogether dependent on the
senses, and therefore untrustworthy, not, however, that it
must necessarily be absolutely false. It is scarcely possible
for us to reconstruct from the remains of his works the
details of his theory, or to show his approach to the Ionian
doctrines by the assumption of the existence in nature of
two opposite species&mdash;ethereal fire and heavy night; of
an equal proportion of which all things consist, fire being
the true, and night the phenomenal. From such an unsubstantial
and delusive basis it would not repay us, even if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
we had the means of accomplishing it, to give an exposition
of his physical system. In many respects it degenerated
into a wild vagary; as, for example, when he placed an
overruling dæmon in the centre of the phenomenal world.
Nor need we be detained by his extravagant reproduction of
the old doctrine of the generation of animals from miry clay,
nor follow his explanation of the nature of man, who, since
he is composed of light and darkness, participates in both,
and can never ascertain absolute truth. By other routes,
and upon far less fanciful principles, modern philosophy
has at last come to the same melancholy conclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrines of
Parmenides
carried out
by Zeno;</div>

<p>The doctrines of Parmenides were carried out by Zeno
the Eleatic, who is said to have been his adopted
son. He brought into use the method of refuting
error by the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. His compositions
were in prose, and not in poetry, as
were those of his predecessors. As it had been the
object of Parmenides to establish the existence of
"the One," it was the object of Zeno to establish the
non-existence of "the Many." Agreeably to such principles,
he started from the position that only one thing
really exists, and that all others are mere modifications or
appearances of it. He denied motion, but admitted the
appearance of it; regarding it as a name given to a series
of conditions, each of which is necessarily rest. This
dogma against the possibility of motion he maintained by
four arguments; the second of them is the celebrated
Achilles puzzle. It is thus stated: "Suppose Achilles to
run ten times as fast as a tortoise, yet, if the tortoise has
the start, Achilles can never overtake him; for, if they
are separated at first by an interval of a thousand feet,
when Achilles has run these thousand feet the tortoise will
have run a hundred, and when Achilles has run these
hundred the tortoise will have got on ten, and so on for
ever; therefore Achilles may run for ever without overtaking
the tortoise." Such were his arguments against the existence
of motion; his proof of the existence of One, the
indivisible and infinite, may thus be stated: "To suppose
that the one is divisible is to suppose it finite. If divisible,
it must be infinitely divisible. But suppose two things
to exist, then there must necessarily be an interval between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
those two&mdash;something separating and limiting them.
What is that something? It is some <i>other</i> thing. But
then if not the <i>same</i> thing, <i>it also</i> must be separated and
limited, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Thus only one thing can
exist as the substratum for all manifold appearances."
Zeno furnishes us with an illustration of the fallibility
of the indications of sense in his argument against
Protagoras. It may be here introduced as a specimen of
his method: "He asked if a grain of corn, or the ten
thousandth part of a grain, would, when it fell to the
ground, make a noise. Being answered in the negative,
he further asked whether, then, would a measure of corn.
This being necessarily affirmed, he then demanded whether
the measure was not in some determinate ratio to the
single grain; as this could not be denied, he was able to
conclude, either, then, the bushel of corn makes no noise on
falling, or else the very smallest portion of a grain does
the same."</p>

<div class="sidenote">and by Melissus
of Samos.</div>

<p>To the names already given as belonging to the Eleatic
school may be added that of Melissus of Samos,
who also founded his argument on the nature of
Being, deducing its unity, unchangeability, and indivisibility.
He denied, like the rest of his school, all change
and motion, regarding them as mere illusions of the senses.
From the indivisibility of being he inferred its incorporeality,
and therefore denied all bodily existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biography of
Empedocles.</div>

<p>The list of Eleatic philosophers is doubtfully closed by
the name of Empedocles of Agrigentum, who
in legend almost rivals Pythagoras. In the East
he learned medicine and magic, the art of working
miracles, of producing rain and wind. He decked himself
in priestly garments, a golden girdle, and a crown, proclaiming
himself to be a god. It is said by some that he
never died, but ascended to the skies in the midst of a
supernatural glory. By some it is related that he leaped
into the crater of Etna, that, the manner of his death being
unknown, he might still continue to pass for a god&mdash;an
expectation disappointed by an eruption which cast out one
of his brazen sandals.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the school to which he belonged, he relied
on Reason and distrusted the Senses. From his fragments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it has been inferred that he was sceptical of the guidance
of the former as well as of the latter, founding his distrust
on the imperfection the soul has contracted, and for
which it has been condemned to existence in this world, and
even to transmigration from body to body. Adopting the
Eleatic doctrine that like can be only known by like, fire
<span class="sidenote">He mingles
mysticism with philosophy.</span>
by fire, love by love, the recognition of the divine by man
is sufficient proof that the Divine exists. His primary
elements were four&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, and Water; to these
he added two principles, Love and Hate. The
four elements he regarded as four gods, or divine
eternal forces, since out of them all things are
made. Love he regards as the creative power, the
destroyer or modifier being Hate. It is obvious, therefore,
that in him the strictly philosophical system of Xenophanes
had degenerated into a mixed and mystical view, in which
the physical, the metaphysical, and the moral were confounded
together; and that, as the necessary consequence
of such a state, the principles of knowledge were becoming
unsettled, a suspicion arising that all philosophical systems
were untrustworthy, and a general scepticism was already
setting in.</p>

<p>To this result also, in no small degree, the labours of
Democritus of Abdera tended. He had had the advantages
derived from wealth in the procurement of knowledge, for
it is said that his father was rich enough to be able to
entertain the Persian King Xerxes, who was so gratified
thereby that he left several Magi and Chaldæans to complete
the education of the youth. On his father's death,
Democritus, dividing with his brothers the estate, took as
his portion the share consisting of money, leaving to them
the lands, that he might be better able to devote himself to
travelling. He passed into Egypt, Ethiopia, Persia, and
India, gathering knowledge from all those sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Democritus
asserts the untrustworthiness
of knowledge.</div>

<p>According to Democritus, "Nothing is true, or, if so, is
not certain to us." Nevertheless, as, in his system sensation
constitutes thought, and, at the same time,
is but a change in the sentient being, "sensations
are of necessity true;" from which somewhat
obscure passage we may infer that, in the view
of Democritus, though sensation is true subjectively, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
not true objectively. The sweet, the bitter, the hot, the
cold, are simply creations of the mind; but in the outer
object to which we append them, atoms and space alone
exist, and our opinion of the properties of such objects is
founded upon images emitted by them falling upon the
senses. Confounding in this manner sensation with
thought, and making them identical, he, moreover, included
Reflexion as necessary for true knowledge, Sensation by
itself being untrustworthy. Thus, though Sensation may
indicate to us that sweet, bitter, hot, cold, occur in bodies,
Reflexion teaches us that this is altogether an illusion, and
that, in reality, atoms and space alone exist.</p>

<p>Devoting his attention, then, to the problem of perception&mdash;how
the mind becomes aware of the existence of
external things&mdash;he resorted to the hypothesis that they
constantly throw off images of themselves, which are
assimilated by the air through which they have to pass,
and enter the soul by pores in its sensitive organs. Hence
such images, being merely of the superficial form, are
necessarily imperfect and untrue, and so, therefore, must
be the knowledge yielded by them. Democritus rejected
the one element of the Eleatics, affirming that there must
<span class="sidenote">He introduces
the atomic theory.</span>
be many; but he did not receive the four of Empedocles,
nor his principles of Love and Hate, nor the hom&oelig;omeriæ
of Anaxagoras. He also denied that the primary
elements had any sensible qualities whatever.
He conceived of all things as being composed of
invisible, intangible, and indivisible particles or atoms,
which, by reason of variation in their configuration, combination,
or position, give rise to the varieties of forms: to
the atom he imputed self-existence and eternal duration.
His doctrine, therefore, explains how it is that the many
can arise from the one, and in this particular he reconciled
<span class="sidenote">Destiny, Fate
and resistless law.</span>
the apparent contradictions of the Ionians and Eleatics.
The theory of chemistry, as it now exists,
essentially includes his views. The general
formative principle of Nature he regarded as
being Destiny or Fate; but there are indications that by
this he meant nothing more than irreversible law.</p>

<p>A system thus based upon severe mathematical considerations,
and taking as its starting-point a vacuum and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
atoms&mdash;the former actionless and passionless; which
considers the production of new things as only new
aggregations, and the decay of the old as separations;
which recognizes in compound bodies specific arrangements
of atoms to one another; which can rise to the
conception that even a single atom may constitute a
world&mdash;such a system may commend itself to our attention
for its results, but surely not to our approval, when
we find it carrying us to the conclusions that even
<span class="sidenote">Is led to atheism.</span>
mathematical cognition is a mere semblance; that the
soul is only a finely-constituted form fitted into the
grosser bodily frame; that even for reason itself
there is an absolute impossibility of all certainty;
that scepticism is to be indulged in to that degree
that we may doubt whether, when a cone has been cut
asunder, its two surfaces are alike; that the final result
of human inquiry is the absolute demonstration that man
is incapable of knowledge; that, even if the truth be in
his possession, he can never be certain of it; that the
world is an illusive phantasm, and that there is no God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legends of
Democritus.</div>

<p>I need scarcely refer to the legendary stories related of
Democritus, as that he put out his eyes with a
burning-glass that he might no longer be
deluded with their false indications, and more tranquilly
exercise his reason&mdash;a fiction bearing upon its face the
contemptuous accusation of his antagonists, but, by the
stolidity of subsequent ages, received as an actual fact
instead of a sarcasm. As to his habit of so constantly
deriding the knowledge and follies of men that he universally
acquired the epithet of the laughing philosopher, we
may receive the opinion of the great physician Hippocrates,
who being requested by the people of Abdera to
cure him of his madness, after long discoursing with him,
expressed himself penetrated with admiration, and even
with the most profound veneration for him, and rebuked
those who had sent him with the remark that they themselves
were the more distempered of the two.</p>

<p>Thus far European Greece had done but little in the
cause of philosophy. The chief schools were in Asia
Minor, or among the Greek colonies of Italy. But the
time had now arrived when the mother country was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Rise of philosophy
in European Greece.</span>
enter upon a distinguished career, though, it must be
confessed, from a most unfavourable beginning.
This was by no means the only occasion on
which the intellectual activity of the Greek colonies
made itself felt in the destinies of Europe.
The mercantile character in a community has ever been
found conducive to mental activity and physical adventure;
it holds in light esteem prescriptive opinion,
and puts things at the actual value they at the time
possess. If the Greek colonies thus discharged the
important function of introducing and disseminating
speculative philosophy, we shall find them again, five
hundred years later, occupied with a similar task on the
advent of that period in which philosophical speculation
was about to be supplanted by religious faith. For there
<span class="sidenote">Commercial communities
favourable to new ideas.</span>
can be no doubt that, humanly speaking, the cause of
the rapid propagation of Christianity, in its
first ages, lay in the extraordinary facilities
existing among the commercial communities
scattered all around the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea, from the ports of the Levant to those of
France and Spain. An incessant intercourse was kept up
among them during the five centuries before Christ; it
became, under Roman influence, more and more active,
and of increasing political importance. Such a state of
things is in the highest degree conducive to the propagation
of thought, and, indeed, to its origination, through
the constant excitement it furnishes to intellectual
activity. Commercial communities, in this respect, present
a striking contrast to agricultural. By their aid
speculative philosophy was rapidly disseminated everywhere,
as was subsequently Christianity. But the agriculturists
steadfastly adhered with marvellous stolidity to
their ancestral traditions and polytheistic absurdities,
until the very designation&mdash;paganism&mdash;under which their
system passes was given as a nickname derived from
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophical
influence of
the Greek
colonies.</div>

<p>The intellectual condition of the Greek colonies of Italy
and Sicily has not attracted the attention of critics in the
manner it deserves. For, though its political result may
appear to those whose attention is fixed by mere material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
aggrandizement to have been totally eclipsed by the subsequent
power of the Roman republic, to one
who looks at things in a mere general way
it may be a probable inquiry whether the philosophy
cultivated in those towns has not,
in the course of ages, produced as solid and lasting results
as the military achievements of the Eternal City. The
relations of the Italian peninsula to the career of European
civilization are to be classified under three epochs, the
first corresponding to the philosophy generated in the
southern Greek towns: this would have attained the
elevation long before reached in the advanced systems of
India had it not been prevented by the rapid development
of Roman power; the second presents the military
influence of republican and imperial Rome; to the third
belongs the agency of ecclesiastical Rome&mdash;for the production
of the last we shall find hereafter that the
preceding two conspire. The Italian effect upon the
whole has therefore been philosophical, material, and
mixed. We are greatly in want of a history of the first,
for which doubtless many facts still remain to a painstaking
and enlightened inquirer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the
Greek colonial
system.</div>

<p>It was on account of her small territory and her
numerous population that Greece was obliged to colonize.
To these motives must be added internal dissensions, and
particularly the consequences of unequal marriages. So
numerous did these colonies and their offshoots become, that
a great Greek influence pervaded all the Mediterranean
shores and many of the most important
islands, attention more particularly being paid
to the latter, from their supposed strategical value; thus,
in the opinion of Alexander the Great, the command of
the Mediterranean lay in the possession of Cyprus. The
Greek colonists were filibusters; they seized by force the
women wherever they settled, but their children were
taught to speak the paternal language, as has been the
case in more recent times with the descendants of the
Spaniards in America. The wealth of some of these
Greek colonial towns is said to have been incredible.
Crotona was more than twelve miles in circumference;
and Sybaris, another of the Italiot cities, was so luxurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and dissipated as even to give rise to a proverb. The
prosperity of these places was due to two causes: they
were not only the centres of great agricultural districts,
but carried on also an active commerce in all directions, the
dense population of the mother country offering them a
steady and profitable market; they also maintained an
active traffic with all the Mediterranean cities; thus, if
they furnished Athens with corn, they also furnished
Carthage with oil. In the Greek cities connected with
this colonial system, especially in Athens, the business of
ship-building and navigation was so extensively prosecuted
as to give a special character to public life. In
other parts of Greece, as in Sparta, it was altogether
different. In that state the laws of Lycurgus had abolished
private property; all things were held in common;
savage life was reduced to a system, and therefore there
was no object in commerce. But in Athens, commerce was
regarded as being so far from dishonourable that some of
the most illustrious men, whose names have descended to
us as philosophers, were occupied with mercantile pursuits.
Aristotle kept a druggist's shop in Athens, and Plato sold
oil in Egypt.</p>

<p>It was the intention of Athens, had she succeeded in the
conquest of Sicily, to make an attempt upon Carthage,
foreseeing therein the dominion of the Mediterranean, as
was actually realized subsequently by Rome. The destruction
of that city constituted the point of ascendancy
in the history of the Great Republic. Carthage stood
upon a peninsula forty-five miles round, with a neck only
three miles across. Her territory has been estimated as
having a sea-line of not less than 1400 miles, and containing
300 towns; she had also possessions in Spain, in
Sicily, and other Mediterranean islands, acquired, not by
conquest, but by colonization. In the silver mines of
Spain she employed not less than forty thousand men. In
these respects she was guided by the maxims of her
Ph&oelig;nician ancestry, for the Tyrians had colonized for
depôts, and had forty stations of that kind in the Mediterranean.
Indeed, Carthage herself originated in that
way, owing her development to the position she held at
the junction of the east and west basins. The Carthaginian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
merchants did not carry for hire, but dealt in their
<span class="sidenote">Carthaginian
supremacy in the Mediterranean.</span>
commodities. This implied an extensive system
of depôts and bonding. They had anticipated
many of the devices of modern commerce. They
effected insurances, made loans on bottomry, and
it has been supposed that their leathern money may have
been of the nature of our bank notes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts of
the Persians
at dominion
in the Mediterranean.</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter we have spoken of the attempts
of the Asiatics on Egypt and the south shore of
the Mediterranean; we have now to turn to
their operations on the north shore, the consequences
of which are of the utmost interest in
the history of philosophy. It appears that the cities of
Asia Minor, after their contest with the Lydian kings,
had fallen an easy prey to the Persian power. It remained,
therefore, only for that power to pass to the
European continent. A pretext is easily found where the
policy is so clear. So far as the internal condition of
Greece was concerned, nothing could be more tempting to
an invader. There seemed to be no bond of union between
the different towns, and, indeed, the more prominent ones
<span class="sidenote">Contest between
them and the Greeks.</span>
might be regarded as in a state of chronic revolution. In
Athens, since <small>B.C.</small> 622, the laws of Draco had been supplanted
by those of Solon; and again and again the
government had been seized by violence or gained through
intrigue by one adventurer after another. Under these
circumstances the Persian king passed an army
into Europe. The military events of both this
and the succeeding invasion under Xerxes have
been more than sufficiently illustrated by the brilliant
imagination of the lively Greeks. It was needless, however,
to devise such fictions as the million of men who
crossed into Europe, or the two hundred thousand who lay
dead upon the field after the battle of Platæa. If there
<span class="sidenote">The fifty years' war,
and eventual supremacy of Athens.</span>
were not such stubborn facts as the capture and burning
of Athens, the circumstance that these wars
lasted for fifty years would be sufficient to inform
us that all the advantages were not on one
side. Wars do not last so long without bringing
upon both parties disasters as well as conferring
glories; and had these been as exterminating and over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>whelming
as classical authors have supposed, our surprise
may well be excited that the Persian annals have preserved
so little memory of them. Greece did not perceive that,
if posterity must take her accounts as true, it must give
the palm of glory to Persia, who could, with unfaltering
perseverance, persist in attacks illustrated by such unparalleled
catastrophes. She did not perceive that the
annals of a nation may be more splendid from their exhibiting
a courage which could bear up for half a century
against continual disasters, and extract victory at last from
defeat.</p>

<p>In pursuance of their policy, the Persians extended their
dominion to Cyrene and Barca on the south, as well as to
Thrace and Macedonia on the north. The Persian wars
gave rise to that wonderful development in Greek art
which has so worthily excited the admiration of subsequent
ages. The assertion is quite true that after those wars the
Greeks could form in sculpture living men. On the part
of the Persians, these military undertakings were not of
the base kind so common in antiquity; they were the
carrying out of a policy conceived with great ability, their
object being to obtain countries for tribute and not for
devastation. The great critic Niebuhr, by whose opinions
I am guided in the views I express of these events, admits
that the Greek accounts, when examined, present little
that was possible. The Persian empire does not seem to
have suffered at all; and Plato, whose opinion must be
considered as of very great authority, says that, on the
whole, the Persian wars reflect extremely little honour on
the Greeks. It was asserted that only thirty-one towns,
and most of them small ones, were faithful to Greece.
Treason to her seems for years in succession to have infected
all her ablest men. It was not Pausanias alone who
wanted to be king under the supremacy of Persia. Such a
satrap would have borne about the same relation to the
great king as the modern pacha does to the grand seignior.
However, we must do justice to those able men. A king
was what Greece in reality required; had she secured one
at this time strong enough to hold her conflicting interests
in check, she would have become the mistress of the world.
Her leading men saw this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The consequence
is her
vast intellectual
progress.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The elevating effect of the Persian wars was chiefly felt
in Athens. It was there that the grand development of
pure art, literature, and science took place. As
to Sparta, she remained barbarous as she had
ever been; the Spartans continuing robbers and
impostors, in their national life exhibiting not a
single feature that can be commended. Mechanical art
reached its perfection at Corinth; real art at Athens, finding
a multitude not only of true, but also of new expressions.
Before Pericles the only style of architecture
was the Doric; his became at once the age of perfect
<span class="sidenote">Her progress in art.</span>
beauty. It also became the age of freedom in thinking
and departure from the national faith. In this
respect the history of Pericles and of Aspasia is
very significant. His, also, was the great age of oratory,
but of oratory leading to delusion, the democratical forms
of Athens being altogether deceptive, power ever remaining
in the hands of a few leading men, who did everything.
The true popular sentiment, as was almost always
the case under those ancient republican institutions, could
find for itself no means of expression. The great men
were only too prone to regard their fellow-citizens as a
rabble, mere things to be played off against one another,
and to consider that the objects of life are dominion and
lust, that love, self-sacrifice, and devotion are fictions; that
oaths are only good for deception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The treaty
with Persia.</div>

<p>Though the standard of statesmanship, at the period of
the Persian wars, was very low, there can be no doubt that
among the Greek leaders were those who clearly understood
the causes of the Asiatic attack; and hence, with an instinct
of self-preservation, defensive alliances were continually
maintained with Egypt. When their valour and
endurance had given to the Greeks a glorious
issue to the war, the articles contained in the final treaty
manifest clearly the motives and understandings of both
parties. No Persian vessel was to appear between the
Cyanean Rocks and Chelidonian Islands; no Persian army
to approach within three days' journey of the Mediterranean
Sea, <small>B.C.</small> 449.</p>

<p>To Athens herself the war had given political supremacy.
We need only look at her condition fifty years after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
battle of Platæa. She was mistress of more than a thousand
miles of the coast of Asia Minor; she held as dependencies
more than forty islands; she controlled the straits between
Europe and Asia; her fleets ranged the Mediterranean and
the Black Seas; she had monopolized the trade of all the
adjoining countries; her magazines were full of the most
valuable objects of commerce. From the ashes of the
Persian fire she had risen up so supremely beautiful that
her temples, her statues, her works of art, in
<span class="sidenote">She becomes the centre
of policy and philosophy.</span>
their exquisite perfection, have since had no
parallel in the world. Her intellectual supremacy
equalled her political. To her, as to a focal
point, the rays of light from every direction converged.
The philosophers of Italy and Asia Minor directed their
steps to her as to the acknowledged centre of mental
activity. As to Egypt, an utter ruin had befallen her
since she was desolated by the Persian arms. Yet we
must not therefore infer that though, as conquerors, the
Persians had trodden out the most aged civilization on the
globe, as sovereigns they were haters of knowledge, or
merciless as kings. We must not forget that the Greeks
of Asia Minor were satisfied with their rule, or, at all
events, preferred rather to remain their subjects than to
contract any permanent political connexions with the
conquering Greeks of Europe.</p>

<p>In this condition of political glory, Athens became not
only the birthplace of new and beautiful productions of
art, founded on a more just appreciation of the true than
had yet been attained to in any previous age of the world
(which, it may be added, have never been surpassed, if,
indeed, they have been equalled since), she also became the
receptacle for every philosophical opinion, new and old.
Ionian, Italian, Egyptian, Persian, all were brought to
her, and contrasted and compared together. Indeed, the
philosophical celebrity of Greece is altogether due to
Athens. The rest of the country participated but little
in the cultivation of learning. It is a popular error that
Greece, in the aggregate, was a learned country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of philosophy
at
this juncture.</div>

<p>We have already seen how the researches of individual
inquirers, passing from point to point, had conducted them,
in many instances, to a suspicion of the futility of human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
knowledge; and looking at the results reached by the
successive philosophical schools, we cannot fail
to remark that there was a general tendency to
scepticism. We have seen how, from the material
and tangible beginnings of the Ionians, the Eleatics land
us not only in a blank atheism, but in a disbelief of the
existence of the world. And though it may be said that
these were only the isolated results of special schools, it is
not to be forgotten that they were of schools the most
advanced. The time had now arrived when the name of
a master was no more to usurp the place of reason, as had
been hitherto the case; when these last results of the
different methods of philosophizing were to be brought
together, a criticism of a higher order established, and
conclusions of a higher order deduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commencement
of the
higher analysis.</div>

<p>Thus it will ever be with all human investigation. The
primitive philosophical elements from which we
start are examined, first by one and then by
another, each drawing his own special conclusions
and deductions, and each firmly believing
in the truth of his inferences. Each analyst has
seen the whole subject from a particular point of view,
without concerning himself with the discordances, contradictions,
and incompatibilities obvious enough when his
conclusions come to be compared with those of other analysts
as skilful as himself. In process of time, it needs must be
that a new school of examiners will arise, who, taking the
results at which their predecessors have arrived from an
examination of the primary elements, will institute a
secondary comparison; a comparison of results with results;
a comparison of a higher order, and more likely to lead to
absolute truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration
from subsequent
Roman
history.</div>

<p>Perhaps I cannot better convey what I here mean by
this secondary and higher analysis of philosophical questions
than by introducing, as an illustration, what
took place subsequently in Rome, through her
policy of universal religious toleration. The
priests and followers of every god and of every
faith were permitted to pursue without molestation their
special forms of worship. Of these, it may be supposed
that nearly all were perfectly sincere in their adherence to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
their special divinity, and, if the occasion had arisen, could
have furnished unanswerable arguments in behalf of his
supremacy and of the truth of his doctrines. Yet it is
very clear that, by thus bringing these several primary
systems into contact, a comparison of a secondary and of
a higher order, and therefore far more likely to approach to
absolute truth, must needs be established among them. It
is very well known that the popular result of this secondary
examination was the philosophical rejection of polytheism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sophists.</div>

<p>So, in Athens the result of the secondary examination of
philosophical systems and deductions was scepticism as
regards them all, and the rise of a new order of
men&mdash;the Sophists&mdash;who not only rejected the
validity of all former philosophical methods, but carried
their infidelity to a degree plainly not warranted by the
facts of the case, in this, that they not only denied that
human reason had thus far succeeded in ascertaining anything,
but even affirmed that it is incapable, from its very
nature, as dependent on human organization, or the condition
under which it acts, of determining the truth at all;
nay, that even if the truth is actually in its possession,
since it has no criterion by which to recognize it, it cannot
so much as be certain that it is in such possession of it.
From these principles it follows that, since we have no
standard of the true, neither can we have any standard of
the good, and that our ideas of what is good and what is
evil are altogether produced by education or by convention.
Or, to use the phrase adopted by the Sophists, "it is might
that makes right." Right and wrong are hence seen to be
mere fictions created by society, having no eternal or
absolute existence in nature. The will of a monarch, or of
a majority in a community, declares what the law shall be;
the law defines what is right and what is wrong; and
these, therefore, instead of having an actual existence, are
mere illusions, owing their birth to the exercise of force.
It is might that has determined and defined what is right.
<span class="sidenote">They reject philosophy,
and even morality.</span>
And hence it follows that it is needless for a
man to trouble himself with the monitions of
conscience, or to be troubled thereby, for conscience,
instead of being anything real, is an
imaginary fiction, or, at the best, owes its origin to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
education, and is the creation of our social state. Hence
the wise will give himself no concern as to a meritorious
act or a crime, seeing that the one is intrinsically neither
better nor worse than the other; but he will give himself
sedulous concern as respects his outer or external relations&mdash;his
position in society; conforming his acts to that
standard which it in its wisdom or folly, but in the
exercise of its might, has declared shall be regarded as
right. Or, if his occasions be such as to make it for his
interest to depart from the social rule, let him do it in
secrecy; or, what is far better, let him cultivate rhetoric,
that noble art by which the wrong may be made to
appear the right; by which he who has committed a crime
may so mystify society as to delude it into the belief that he
is worthy of praise; and by which he may prove that his
enemy, who has really performed some meritorious deed,
has been guilty of a crime. Animated by such considerations,
the Sophists passed from place to place, offering to
sell for a sum of money a knowledge of the rhetorical
art, and disposed of their services in the instruction of
the youth of wealthy and noble families.</p>

<p>What shall we say of such a system and of such a state
of things? Simply this: that it indicated a complete
mental and social demoralization&mdash;mental demoralization,
for the principles of knowledge were sapped, and man
persuaded that his reason was no guide; social demoralization,
for he was taught that right and wrong, virtue and
vice, conscience, and law, and God, are imaginary fictions;
that there is no harm in the commission of sin, though
there may be harm, as assuredly there is folly, in being
detected therein; that it is excellent for a man to sell his
country to the Persian king, provided that the sum of
money he receives is large enough, and that the transaction
is so darkly conducted that the public, and particularly
his enemies, can never find it out. Let him never forget
that patriotism is the first delusion of a simpleton, and the
last refuge of a knave.</p>

<p>Such were the results of the first attempt to correct the
partial philosophies, by submitting them to the measure
of a more universal one; such the manner in which, instead
of only losing their exclusiveness and imperfections by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
their contact with one another, they were wrested from
their proper object, and made subservient to the purpose
of deception. Nor was it science alone that was affected;
already might be discerned the foreshadowings of that
<span class="sidenote">They reject the national religion.</span>
conviction which many centuries later occasioned the final
destruction of polytheism in Rome. Already, in Athens,
the voice of philosophers was heard, that among so many
gods and so many different worships it was impossible
for a man to ascertain what is true. Already,
many even of the educated were overwhelmed
with the ominous suggestion that, if ever it had
been the will of heaven to reveal any form of faith to the
world, such a revelation, considering its origin, must
necessarily have come with sufficient power to override all
opposition; that if there existed only as many as two
forms of faith synchronous and successful in the world,
that fact would of itself demonstrate that neither of them
is true, and that there never had been any revelation from
an all-wise and omnipotent God. Nor was it merely
among the speculative men that these infidelities were
cherished; the leading politicians and statesmen had become
deeply infected with them. It was not Anaxagoras
alone who was convicted of atheism; the same charge was
made against Pericles, the head of the republic&mdash;he who
<span class="sidenote">Spread of their opinions among the
highest classes.</span>
had done so much for the glory of Athens&mdash;the
man who, in practical life, was, beyond all
question, the first of his age. With difficulty
he succeeded, by the use of what influence remained
to him, in saving the life of the guilty philosopher
his friend, but in the public estimation he was universally
viewed as a participator in his crime. If the foundations
of philosophy and those of religion were thus sapped, the
foundations of law experienced no better fate. The Sophists,
who were wandering all over the world, saw that each
nation had its own ideas of merit and demerit, and therefore
its own system of law; that even in different towns
there were contrary conceptions of right and wrong, and
therefore opposing codes. It is evident that in such examinations
they applied the same principles which had guided
them in their analysis of philosophy and religion, and that
the result could be no other than it was, to bring them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the conclusion that there is nothing absolute in justice or
in law. To what an appalling condition society has arrived,
when it reaches the positive conclusion that there is no
truth, no religion, no justice, no virtue in the world; that
the only object of human exertion is unrestrained physical
enjoyment; the only standard of a man's position, wealth;
that, since there is no possibility of truth, whose eternal
principles might serve for an uncontrovertible and common
guide, we should resort to deception and the arts of persuasion,
that we may dupe others for our purposes; that
there is no sin in undermining the social contract; no
crime in blasphemy, or rather there is no blasphemy at
all, since there are no gods; that "man is the measure of
all things," as Protagoras teaches, and that "he is the
criterion of existence;" that "thought is only the relation
of the thinking subject to the object thought of, and that
<span class="sidenote">They end
in blank atheism.</span>
the thinking subject, the soul, is nothing more than the
sum of the different moments of thinking." It is no wonder
that that Sophist who was the author of such doctrines
should be condemned to death to satisfy the clamours
of a populace who had not advanced sufficiently
into the depths of this secondary, this higher
philosophy, and that it was only by flight that
he could save himself from the punishment awaiting the
opening sentiment of his book: "Of the gods I cannot tell
whether they are or not, for much hinders us from knowing
this&mdash;both the obscurity of the subject and the shortness
of life." It is no wonder that the social demoralization
spread apace, when men like Gorgias, the disciple of
Empedocles, were to be found, who laughed at virtue,
made an open derision of morality, and proved, by metaphysical
demonstration, that nothing at all exists.</p>

<p>From these statements respecting the crisis at which
ancient philosophy had arrived, we might be disposed to
believe that the result was unmitigated evil, for it scarcely
deserves mention that the quibbles and disputes of the
Sophists occasioned an extraordinary improvement of the
Greek language, introducing precision into its terms, and
a wonderful dialectical skill into its use. For us there may
be extracted from these melancholy conclusions at least
one instructive lesson&mdash;that it is not during the process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
decomposition of philosophies, and especially of religions,
<span class="sidenote">Political dangers of
the higher analysis.</span>
that social changes occur, for such breakings-up
commonly go on in an isolated, and therefore
innocuous way; but if by chance the fragments
and decomposed portions are brought together,
and attempts are made by fusion to incorporate them anew,
or to extract from them, by a secondary analysis, what
truth they contain, a crisis is at once brought on, and&mdash;such
is the course of events&mdash;in the catastrophe that ensues
<span class="sidenote">Illustrations
from the Middle Ages.</span>
they are commonly all absolutely destroyed. It was doubtless
their foresight of such consequences that inspired the
Italian statesmen of the Middle Ages with a
resolute purpose of crushing in the bud every
encroachment on ecclesiastical authority, and
every attempt at individual interpretation of religious
doctrines. For it is not to be supposed that men of clear
intellect should be insensible to the obvious unreasonableness
of many of the dogmas that had been consecrated by
authority. But if once permission were accorded to human
criticism and human interpretation, what other issue could
there be than that doctrine upon doctrine, and sect upon
sect should arise; that theological principles should undergo
a total decomposition, until two men could scarcely be
found whose views coincided; nay, even more than that,
that the same man should change his opinion with the
changing incidents of the different periods of his life. No
matter what might be the plausible guise of the beginning,
and the ostensibly cogent arguments for its necessity, once
let the decomposition commence, and no human power
could arrest it until it had become thorough and complete.
Considering the prestige, the authority, and the mass of
fact to be dealt with, it might take many centuries for
this process to be finished, but that that result would at
length be accomplished no enlightened man could doubt.
The experience of the ancient European world had shown
that in the act of such decompositions there is but little
danger, since, for the time being, each sect, and, indeed,
each individual, has a guiding rule of life. But as soon
as the period of secondary analysis is reached a crisis must
inevitably ensue, in all probability involving not only
religion, but also the social contract. And though, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
exercise of force on the part of the interests that are disturbed,
<span class="sidenote">Danger of

of faith.</span>
aided by that popular sentiment which is abhorrent
of anarchy, the crisis might, for a time, be put
off, it could not be otherwise than that Europe
should be left in that deplorable state which
must result when the intellect of a people has
outgrown its formulas of faith. A fearful condition to
contemplate, for such a dislocation must also affect political
relations, and necessarily implies revolt against existing
law. Nations plunged in the abyss of irreligion must
necessarily be nations in anarchy. For a time their
tendency to explosion may be kept down by the firm application
of the hand of power; but this is simply an antagonism,
it is no cure. The social putrefaction proceeds,
working its way downward into classes that are lower and
lower, until at length it involves the institutions that are
relied on for its arrest. Armies, the machinery of compression,
once infected, the end is at hand, but no human
<span class="sidenote">Absolute necessity of preparing
communities for these changes.</span>
foresight can predict what the event shall be, especially if
the contemporaneous ruling powers have either
ignorantly or wilfully neglected to prepare
society for the inevitable trial it is about to
undergo. It is the most solemn of all the duties
of governments, when once they have become aware of
such a momentous condition, to prepare the nations for
its fearful consequences. For this it may, perhaps, be
lawful for them to dissemble in a temporary manner, as it
is sometimes proper for a physician to dissemble with his
patient; it may be lawful for them even to resort to the
use of force, but never should such measures of doubtful
correctness be adopted without others directed to a preparation
of the mass of society for the trials through which
it is about to pass. Such, doubtless, were the profound
views of the great Italian statesmen of the Middle Ages;
such, doubtless, were the arguments by which they justified
to themselves resistance against the beginning of the
evil&mdash;a course for which Europe has too often and unfairly
condemned them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of
the preceding
theories.</div>

<p>It remains for us now to review the details presented in
the foregoing pages for the purpose of determining the
successive phases of development through which the Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
mind passed. It is not with the truth or fallacy of these
details that we have to do, but with their order
of occurrence. They are points enabling us
to describe graphically the curve of Grecian
intellectual advance.</p>

<p>The starting point of Greek philosophy is physical and
geocentral. The earth is the grand object of the universe,
and, as the necessary result, erroneous ideas are entertained
as to the relations and dimensions of the sea and air.
This philosophy was hardly a century old before it began
to cosmogonize, using the principles it considered itself
sure of. Long before it was able to get rid of local ideas,
such as upward and downward in space, it undertook to
explain the origin of the world.</p>

<p>But, as advances were made, it was recognized that
creation, in its various parts, displays intention and
design, the adaptation of means to secure proposed ends.
This suggested a reasoning and voluntary agency, like
that of man, in the government of the world; and from a
continual reference to human habits and acts, Greek philosophy
passed through its stage of anthropoid conceptions.</p>

<p>A little farther progress awakened suspicions that the
mind of man can obtain no certain knowledge; and the
opinion at last prevailed that we have no trustworthy
criterion of truth. In the scepticism thus setting in, the
approach to Oriental ideas is each successive instant more
and more distinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approach to
Oriental ideas.</div>

<p>This period of doubt was the immediate forerunner of
more correct cosmical opinions. The heliocentric mechanism
of the planetary system was introduced, the earth
deposed to a subordinate position. The doctrines, both
physical and intellectual, founded on geocentric ideas,
were necessarily endangered, and, since these had connected
themselves with the prevailing religious views, and were
represented by important material interests, the public
began to practise persecution and the philosophers hypocrisy.
Pantheistic notions of the nature of the world
became more distinct, and, as their necessary
consequence, the doctrines of Emanation, Transmigration,
and Absorption were entertained. From this
it is but a step to the suspicion that matter, motion, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
time are phantasms of the imagination&mdash;opinions embodied
in the atomic theory, which asserts that atoms and space
alone exist; and which became more refined when it
recognized that atoms are only mathematical points; and
still more so when it considered them as mere centres of
force. The brink of Buddhism was here approached.</p>

<p>As must necessarily ever be the case where men are
coexisting in different psychical stages of advance, some
having made a less, some a greater intellectual progress,
all these views which we have described successively, were
at last contemporaneously entertained. At this point commenced
the action of the Sophists, who, by setting the
doctrines of one school in opposition to those of another,
and representing them all as of equal value, occasioned
the destruction of them all, and the philosophy founded
on physical speculation came to an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uniformity
in the manner
of intellectual
progress.</div>

<p>Of this phase of Greek intellectual life, if we compare
the beginning with the close, we cannot fail to observe
how great is the improvement. The thoughts
dealt with at the later period are intrinsically
of a higher order than those at the outset. From
the puerilities and errors with which we have
thus been occupied, we learn that there is a definite mode
of progress for the mind of man; from the history of later
times we shall find that it is ever in the same direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek philosophy
on the
basis of ethics.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sophists had brought on an intellectual anarchy. It
is not in the nature of humanity to be contented
with such a state. Thwarted in its expectations
from physics, the Greek mind turned its attention
to morals. In the progress of life, it is but a step
from the age of Inquiry to the age of Faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Socrates: his
mode of
teaching.</div>

<p>Socrates, who led the way in this movement, was born
<small>B.C.</small> 469. He exercised an influence in some respects felt
to our times. Having experienced the unprofitable results
arising from physical speculation, he set in contrast there
with the solid advantages to be enjoyed from
the cultivation of virtue and morality. His
life was a perpetual combat with the Sophists.
His manner of instruction was by conversation, in which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
according to the uniform testimony of all who heard
him, he singularly excelled. He resorted to definitions,
and therefrom drew deductions, conveying his argument
under the form of a dialogue. Unlike his predecessors,
who sought for truth in the investigation of outward
things, he turned his attention inward, asserting the
supremacy of virtue and its identity with knowledge, and
the necessity of an adherence to the strict principles of
justice. Considering the depraved condition to which the
Sophists had reduced society, he insisted on a change in
the manner of education of youth, so as to bring it in
accordance with the principle that happiness is only to be
found in the pursuit of virtue and goodness. Thus, therefore,
he completely substituted the moral for the physical,
and in this essentially consists the philosophical revolution
he effected. He had no school, properly speaking, nor did
he elaborate any special ethical system; to those who
inquired how they should know good from evil and right
from wrong, he recommended the decisions of the laws of
<span class="sidenote">The doctrines of Socrates.</span>
their country. It does not appear that he ever
entered on any inquiry respecting the nature of
God, simply viewing his existence as a fact of which
there was abundant and incontrovertible proof. Though
rejecting the crude religious ideas of his nation, and
totally opposed to anthropomorphism, he carefully
avoided the giving of public offence by improper allusions
to the prevailing superstition; nay, even as a good
citizen, he set an example of conforming to its requirements.
In his judgment, the fault of the Sophists consisted
in this, that they had subverted useless speculation,
but had substituted for it no scientific evidence. Nevertheless,
if man did not know, he might believe, and
demonstration might be profitably supplanted by faith.
He therefore insisted on the great doctrines of the immortality
of the soul and the government of the world by
Providence; but it is not to be denied that there are plain
indications, in some of his sentiments, of a conviction that
the Supreme Being is the soul of the world. He professed
that his own chief wisdom consisted in the knowledge of
his own ignorance, and dissuaded his friends from the
cultivation of mathematics and physics, since he affirmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Opposes mathematics and physics.</span>
that the former leads to vain conclusions, the latter to
atheism. In his system everything turns on
the explanation of terms; but his processes of
reasoning are often imperfect, his conclusions,
therefore, liable to be incorrect. In this way, he maintained
that no one would knowingly commit a wrong act, because
he that knew a thing to be good would do it; that it is
only involuntarily that the bad are bad; that he who
knowingly tells a lie is a better man than he who tells a
lie in ignorance; and that it is right to injure one's
enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superficiality
of his views.</div>

<p>From such a statement of the philosophy of Socrates, we
cannot fail to remark how superficial it must
have been; it perpetually mistakes differences
of words for distinctions of things; it also possessed little
novelty. The enforcement of morality cannot be regarded
as anything new, since probably there has never been an
age in which good men were not to be found, who observed,
as their rule of life, the maxims taught by Socrates; and
hence we may reasonably inquire what it was that has
spread over the name of this great man such an unfading
lustre, and why he stands out in such extraordinary
prominence among the benefactors of his race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the
celebrity of
Socrates.</div>

<p>Socrates was happy in two things: happy in those who
recorded his life, and happy in the circumstances
of his death. It is not given to every great man
to have Xenophon and Plato for his biographers;
it is not given to every one who has overpassed the limit
of life, and, in the natural course of events, has but a little
longer to continue, to attain the crown of martyrdom in
behalf of virtue and morality. In an evil hour for the
glory of Athens, his countrymen put him to death. It
was too late when they awoke and saw that they could
give no answer to the voice of posterity, demanding why
they had perpetrated this crime. With truth Socrates
said, at the close of his noble speech to the judges who had
condemned him, "It is now time that we depart&mdash;I to die,
you to live; but which has the better destiny is unknown
to all except God." The future has resolved that doubt.
For Socrates there was reserved the happier lot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ostensible
accusations
against him.</div>

<p>No little obscurity still remains as respects the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
nature of this dark transaction. The articles of accusation
were three: he rejects the gods of his country;
he introduces new ones; he perverts the education
of youth. With truth might his friends say
it was wonderful that he should be accused of impiety, the
whole tenor of whose life was reverence for God&mdash;a recognition
not only of the divine existence, but of the divine
superintendence. "It is only a madman," he would say,
"who imputes success in life to human prudence;" and as
to the necessity of a right education for the young, "It is
only the wise who are fit to govern men." We must conclude
that the accusations were only ostensible or fictitious,
and that beneath them lay some reality which could
reconcile the Athenians to the perpetration of so great a
crime.</p>

<p>Shall we find in his private life any explanation of this
mystery? Unfortunately, the details of it which have
descended to us are few. To the investigations of classical
criticism we can scarcely look with any hope, for classical
criticism has hitherto been in a state of singular innocence,
so far as the actual affairs of life are concerned. It regards
Athenians and Romans not as men and women like ourselves,
but as the personages presented by fictitious
literature, whose lives are exceptions to the common laws
of human nature; who live in the midst of scenes of
endless surprises and occurrences ever bordering on the
marvellous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The character
of Socrates in Athens.</div>

<p>If we examine the case according to everyday principles,
we cannot fail to remark that the Socrates of our
imagination is a very different man from the
Socrates of contemporaneous Athenians. To us
he appears a transcendent genius, to whom the great
names of antiquity render their profound homage; a
martyr in behalf of principles, of which, if society be devoid,
life itself is scarcely of any worth, and for the defence of
which it is the highest glory that a man should be called
upon to die. To them Socrates was no more than an idle
lounger in the public places and corners of the streets;
grotesque, and even repulsive in his person; affecting in the
oddities of his walking and in his appearance many of the
manners of the mountebank. Neglecting the pursuit of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
honest calling, for his trade seems to have been that of a
stone-cutter, he wasted his time in discoursing with such
youths as his lecherous countenance and satyr-like person
could gather around him, leading them astray from the
gods of his country, the flimsy veil of his hypocrisy being
too transparent to conceal his infidelity. Nevertheless, he
was a very brave soldier, as those who served with him
testify. It does not appear that he was observant of those
cares which by most men are probably considered as paramount,
<span class="sidenote">Xantippe his wife.</span>
giving himself but little concern for the support of
his children and wife. The good woman Xantippe is, to
all appearance, one of those characters who are
unfairly judged of by the world. Socrates
married her because of her singular conversational powers;
and though he himself, according to universal testimony,
possessed extraordinary merits in that respect, he found to
his cost, when too late, so commanding were her excellencies,
that he was altogether her inferior. Among the
amusing instances related of his domestic difficulties were
the consequences of his invitations to persons to dine with
him when there was nothing in the house wherewith to
entertain them, a proceeding severely trying to the temper
of Xantippe, whose cause would unquestionably be defended
by the matrons of any nation. It was nothing but the
mortification of a high-spirited woman at the acts of a man
who was too shiftless to have any concern for his domestic
honour. He would not gratify her urgent entreaties by
accepting from those upon whom he lavished his time the
money that was so greatly needed at home. After his
condemnation, she carried her children with her to his
prison, and was dismissed by him, as he told his friends,
from his apprehension of her deep distress. To the last
we see her bearing herself in a manner honourable to a
woman and a wife. There is surely something wrong in
a man's life when the mother of his children is protesting
against his conduct, and her complaints are countenanced
by the community. In view of all the incidents of the
history of Socrates, we can come to no other conclusion
than that the Athenians regarded him as an unworthy,
and perhaps troublesome member of society. There can be
no doubt that his trial and condemnation were connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">He is really the victim of
political animosity.</span>
with political measures. He himself said that he should
have suffered death previously, in the affair of
Leon of Salamis, had not the government been
broken up. His bias was toward aristocracy,
not toward democracy. In common with his
party, he had been engaged in undertakings that could
not do otherwise than entail mortal animosities; and it is
not to be overlooked that his indictment was brought forward
by Anytus, who was conspicuous in restoring the
old order of things. The mistake made by the Athenians
was in applying a punishment altogether beyond the real
offence, and in adding thereto the persecution of those who
had embraced the tenets of Socrates by driving them into
exile. Not only admiration for the memory of their master,
but also a recollection of their own wrongs, made these
men eloquent eulogists. Had Socrates appeared to the
Athenians as he appears to us, it is not consistent with
human proceedings that they should have acted in so
barbarous and totally indefensible a manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dæmon
of Socrates.</div>

<p>If by the Dæmon to whose suggestions Socrates is said
to have listened anything more was meant
than conscience, we must infer that he laboured
under that mental malady to which those are liable who,
either through penury or designedly, submit to extreme
abstinence, and, thereby injuring the brain, fall into
hallucination. Such cases are by no means of infrequent
occurrence. Mohammed was affected in that manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Megaric school. The wise should
be insensible to pain.</div>

<p>After the death of Socrates there arose several schools
professing to be founded upon his principles.
The divergences they exhibited when compared
with one another prove how little there was of
precision in those principles. Among these
imitators is numbered Euclid of Megara, who had been in
the habit of incurring considerable personal risk for the
sake of listening to the great teacher, it being a capital
offence for a native of Megara to be found in Athens. Upon
their persecution, Plato and other disciples of Socrates fled
to Euclid, and were well received by him. His system was
a mixture of the Eleatic and Socratic, the ethical preponderating
in his doctrine. He maintained the existence
of one Being, the Good, having various aspects&mdash;Wisdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
God, Reason, and showed an inclination to the tendency
afterward fully developed by the Cynical school in his
dogma that the wise man should be insensible to pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cyrenaic school. Pleasure
is the object of life.</div>

<p>With the Megaric school is usually classified the Cyrenaic
founded by Aristippus. Like Socrates, he held
in disdain physical speculations, and directed his
attention to the moral. In his opinion, happiness
consists in pleasure; and, indeed, he recognized
in pleasure and pain the criteria of external things. He
denied that we can know anything with certainty, our
senses being so liable to deceive us; but, though we may
not perceive things truly, it is true that we perceive.
With the Cyrenaic school, pleasure was the great end and
object of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cynical school: a contempt
for others and gratification of self.</div>

<p>To these may be added the Cynical school, founded
by Antisthenes, whose system is personal and
ferocious: it is a battle of the mind against the
body; it is a pursuit of pleasure of a mental kind,
corporeal enjoyment being utterly unworthy of a
man. Its nature is very well shown in the
character of its founder, who abandoned all the conveniences
and comforts of life, voluntarily encountering
poverty and exposure to the inclemency of the seasons. His
garments were of the meanest kind, his beard neglected,
his person filthy, his diet bordering on starvation. To the
passers-by this ragged misanthrope indulged in contemptuous
language, and offended them by the indecency of his
gestures. Abandoned at last by every one except Diogenes
<span class="sidenote">Antisthenes.</span>
of Sinope, he expired in extreme wretchedness. It had been
a favourite doctrine with him that friendship
and patriotism are altogether worthless; and in
his last agony, Diogenes asking him whether he needed a
friend, "Will a friend release me from this pain?" he inquired.
Diogenes handed him a dagger, saying, "This will."
"I want to be free from pain, but not from life." Into such
degradation had philosophy, as represented by the Cynical
school, fallen, that it may be doubted whether it is right to
include a man like Antisthenes among those who derive
their title from their love of wisdom&mdash;a man who condemned
the knowledge of reading and writing, who
depreciated the institution of marriage, and professed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he saw no other advantage in philosophy than that it
enabled him to keep company with himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diogenes of Sinope.</div>

<p>The wretched doctrines of Cynicism were carried to their
utmost application by Diogenes of Sinope. In early life
he had been accustomed to luxury and ease;
but his father, who was a wealthy banker, having
been convicted of debasing the coinage, Diogenes, who in
some manner shared in the disgrace, was in a very fit state
of mind to embrace doctrines implying a contempt for the
goods of the world and for the opinions of men. He may
be considered as the prototype of the hermits of a later
period in his attempts at the subjugation of the natural
appetites by means of starvation. Looking upon the body
as a mere clog to the soul, he mortified it in every possible
manner, feeding it on raw meat and leaves, and making it
dwell in a tub. He professed that the nearer a man approaches
to suicide the nearer he approaches to virtue. He
wore no other dress than a scanty cloak; a wallet, a stick,
and a drinking-cup completed his equipment: the cup he
threw away as useless on seeing a boy take water in the
hollow of his hand. It was his delight to offend every
idea of social decency by performing all the acts of life
publicly, asserting that whatever is not improper in itself
ought to be done openly. It is said that his death, which
occurred in his ninetieth year, was in consequence of
devouring a neat's foot raw. From his carrying the
Socratic notions to an extreme, he merits the designation
applied to him, "the mad Socrates." His contempt for the
opinions of others, and his religious disbelief, are illustrated
by an incident related of him, that, having in a
<span class="sidenote">His irreverence.</span>
moment of weakness made a promise to some friends that
he would offer a sacrifice to Diana, he repaired
the next day to her temple, and, taking a louse
from his head, cracked it upon her altar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of morality.</div>

<p>What a melancholy illustration of the tendency of the
human mind do these facts offer. What a quick, yet
inevitable descent from the morality of Socrates. Selfishness
is enthroned; friendship and patriotism are
looked upon as the affairs of a fool; happy is the
man who stands in no need of a friend; still happier he
who has not one. No action is intrinsically bad; even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
robbery, adultery, sacrilege, are only crimes by public
agreement. The sage will take care how he indulges in
the weakness of gratitude or benevolence, or any other such
sickly sentiment. If he can find pleasure, let him enjoy it;
if pain is inflicted on him, let him bear it; but, above all,
let him remember that death is just as desirable as life.</p>

<p>If the physical speculations of Greece had ended in
sophistry and atheism, ethical investigations, it thus
appears, had borne no better fruit. Both systems, when
carried to their consequences, had been found to be not
only useless to society, but actually prejudicial to its best
interests. As far as could be seen, in the times of which
we are speaking, the prospects for civilization were dark
and discouraging; nor did it appear possible that any
successful attempts could be made to extract from philosophy
anything completely suitable to the wants of man.
Yet, in the midst of these discreditable delusions, one of
the friends and disciples of Socrates&mdash;indeed, it may be
said, his chief disciple, Plato, was laying the foundation of
another system, which, though it contained much that was
false and more that was vain, contained also some things
vigorous enough to descend to our times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of Plato.</div>

<p>Plato was born about <small>B.C.</small> 426. Antiquity has often
delighted to cast a halo of mythical glory around
its illustrious names. The immortal works of
this great philosopher seemed to entitle him to more than
mortal honours. A legend, into the authenticity of which
we will abstain from inquiring, asserted that his mother
Perictione, a pure virgin, suffered an immaculate conception
through the influences of Apollo. The god declared
to Ariston, to whom she was about to be married, the
parentage of the child. The wisdom of this great writer
may justify such a noble descent, and, in some degree,
excuse the credulity of his admiring and affectionate
disciples, who gave a ready ear to the impossible story.</p>

<p>To the knowledge acquired by Plato during the eight or
ten years he had spent with Socrates, he added all that
could be obtained from the philosophers of Egypt, Cyrene,
Persia, and Tarentum. With every advantage arising
from wealth and an illustrious parentage, if even it was
only of an earthly kind, for he numbered Solon among his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
ancestors, he availed himself of the teaching of the chief
philosophers of the age, and at length, returning to his
<span class="sidenote">His education and teaching.</span>
native country, founded a school in the grove of Hecademus.
Thrice during his career as a teacher he visited Sicily on
each occasion returning to the retirement of his
academy. He attained the advanced age of eighty-three
years. It has been given to few men to exercise so
profound an influence on the opinions of posterity, and yet
it is said that during his lifetime Plato had no friends. He
quarrelled with most of those who had been his fellow-disciples
of Socrates; and, as might be anticipated from the
venerable age to which he attained, and the uncertain
foundation upon which his doctrines reposed, his opinions
were very often contradictory, and his philosophy exhibited
many variations. To his doctrines we must now attend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrines of Plato. The
three primary principles.</div>

<p>It was the belief of Plato that matter is coeternal with
God, and that, indeed, there are three primary
principles&mdash;God, Matter, Ideas; all animate
and inanimate things being fashioned by God
from matter, which, being capable of receiving
any impress, may be designated with propriety the
Mother of Forms. He held that intellect existed before
such forms were produced, but not antecedently to matter.
To matter he imputed a refractory or resisting quality,
the origin of the disorders and disturbances occurring in
the world; he also regarded it us the cause of evil, accounting
thereby for the preponderance of evil, which must exceed
the good in proportion as matter exceeds ideas. It is not
without reason, therefore, that Plato has been accused of
Magianism. These doctrines are of an Oriental cast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He asserts the existence of a
personal God.</div>

<p>The existence of God, an independent and personal
maker of the world, he inferred from proofs of
intelligence and design presented by natural
objects. "All in the world is for the sake of
the rest, and the places of the single parts are so ordered
as to subserve to the preservation and excellency of the
whole; hence all things are derived from the operation of
a Divine intellectual cause." From the marks of unity in
that design he deduced the unity of God, the Supreme
Intelligence, incorporeal, without beginning, end, or
change. His god is the fashioner and father of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
universe, in contradistinction to impersonal Nature. In
one sense, he taught that the soul is immortal and imperishable;
in another, he denied that each individual
soul either has had or will continue to have an everlasting
duration. From what has been said on a former page, it
will be understood that this psychological doctrine is
<span class="sidenote">Nature of the soul.</span>
essentially Indian. His views of the ancient condition of
and former relations of the soul enabled Plato
to introduce the celebrated doctrine of Reminiscence,
and to account for what have otherwise been
termed innate ideas. They are the recollections of things
with which the soul was once familiar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato's Ideal theory.</div>

<p>The reason of God contemplates and comprehends the
exemplars or original models of all natural forms, whatever
they may be; for visible things are only fleeting shadows,
quickly passing away; ideas or exemplars are everlasting.
With so much power did he set forth this
theory of ideas, and, it must be added, with so
much obscurity, that some have asserted his belief in an
extramundane space in which exist incorporeal beings, the
ideas or original exemplars of all organic and inorganic
forms. An illustration may remove some of the obscurity
of these views. Thus all men, though they may present
different appearances when compared with each other, are
obviously fashioned upon the same model, to which they
all more or less perfectly conform. All trees
<span class="sidenote">Exemplars or types.</span>
of the same kind, though they may differ from
one another, are, in like manner, fashioned upon a common
model, to which they more or less perfectly conform.
To such models, exemplars, or types, Plato gave the
designation of Ideas. Our knowledge thereof is clearly
not obtained from the senses, but from reflection. Now
Plato asserted that these ideas are not only conceptions of
the mind, but actually perceptions or entities having a
real existence; nay, more, that they are the only real
existences. Objects are thus only material embodiments
of ideas, and in representation are not exact; for correspondence
between an object and its model is only so far as
circumstances will permit. Hence we can never determine
all the properties or functions of the idea from an examination
of its imperfect material representation, any more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
than we can discover the character or qualities of a man
from pictures of him, no matter how excellent those
pictures may be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of Reminiscence.</div>

<p>The Ideal theory of Plato, therefore, teaches that,
beyond this world of delusive appearances, this world of
material objects, there is another world, invisible, eternal,
and essentially true; that, though we cannot trust our
senses for the correctness of the indications they yield,
there are other impressions upon which we may fall back
to aid us in coming to the truth, the reminiscences
or recollections still abiding in the soul of
the things it formerly knew, either in the realm of pure
ideas, or in the states of former life through which it has
passed. For Plato says that there are souls which, in
<span class="sidenote">Recollections during transmigration.</span>
periods of many thousand years, have successively transmigrated
through bodies of various kinds. Of
these various conditions they retain a recollection,
more faintly or vividly, as the case may
be. Ideas seeming to be implanted in the human mind,
but certainly never communicated to us by the senses, are
derived from those former states. If this recollection of
ancient events and conditions were absolutely precise and
correct, then man would have an innate means for determining
the truth. But such reminiscences being, in their
nature, imperfect and uncertain, we never can attain to
absolute truth. With Plato, the Beautiful is the perfect
image of the true. Love is the desire of the soul for
Beauty, the attraction of like for like, the longing of the
divinity within us for the divinity beyond us; and the
Good, which is beauty, truth, justice, is God&mdash;God in his
abstract state.</p>

<p>From the Platonic system it therefore followed that
science is impossible to man, and possible only to God;
that, however, recollecting our origin, we ought not to
despair, but elevate our intellectual aim as high as we
may; that all knowledge is not attributable to our present
senses; for, if that were the case, all men would be equally
wise, their senses being equal in acuteness; but a very
large portion, and by far the surest portion, is derived
from reminiscence of our former states; that each individual
soul is an idea; and that, of ideas generally, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">God is the sum of ideas.</span>
lower are held together by the higher, and hence, finally
by one which is supreme; that God is the sum
of ideas, and is therefore eternal and unchangeable,
the sensuous conditions of time and space having no
relation to him, and being inapplicable in any conception
of his attributes; that he is the measure of all things,
and not man, as Protagoras supposed; that the universe is
a type of him; that matter itself is an absolute negation,
and is the same as space; that the forms presented by our
senses are unsubstantial shadows, and no reality; that, so
far from there being an infinity of worlds, there is but
one, which, as the work of God, is neither
<span class="sidenote">The nature of the world and of the gods.</span>
subject to age nor decay, and that it consists of
a body and a soul; in another respect it may be
said to be composed of fire and earth, which can only be
made to cohere through the intermedium of air and water,
and hence the necessity of the existence of the four
elements; that of geometrical forms, the pyramid corresponds
to fire, the cube to earth, the octahedron to air,
these forms being produced from triangles connected by
certain numerical ratios; that the entire sum of vitality
is divided by God into seven parts, answering to the
divisions of the musical octave, or to the seven planets;
that the world is an animal having within it a soul; for
man is warm, and so is the world; man is made of various
elements, and so is the world; and, as the body of man
has a soul, so too must the world have one; that there is
a race of created, generated, and visible gods, who must
be distinguished from the eternal, their bodies being
composed for the most part of fire, their shape spherical;
that the earth is the oldest and first of the starry bodies,
its place being in the centre of the universe, or in the
axis thereof, where it remains, balanced by its own
equilibrium; that perhaps it is an ensouled being and a
generated god; that the mortal races are three, answering
to Earth, Air, and Water; that the male man was the first
made of mortals, and that from him the female, and
beasts, and birds, and fishes issued forth; that the superiority
of man depends upon his being a religious animal;
that each mortal consists of two portions, a soul and a
body&mdash;their separation constitutes death; that of the soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Triple constitution of the soul.</span>
there are two primitive component parts, a mortal and an
immortal, the one being made by the created gods, and
the other by the Supreme; that, for the purpose
of uniting these parts together, it is necessary
that there should be an intermedium, and that
this is the dæmonic portion or spirit; that our mental
struggles arise from this triple constitution of Appetite,
Spirit, and Reason; that Reason alone is immortal, and
the others die; that the number of souls in the universe
is invariable or constant; that the sentiment of pre-existence
proves the soul to have existed before the body;
that, since the soul is the cause of motion, it can neither
be produced nor decay, else all motion must eventually
cease; that, as to the condition of departed
<span class="sidenote">Transmigration and future rewards and punishments.</span>
souls, they hover as shades around the graves,
pining for restoration to their lifeless bodies, or
migrating through various human or brute
shapes, but that an unembodied life in God is reserved for
the virtuous philosopher; that valour is nothing but
knowledge, and virtue a knowledge of good; that the
soul, on entering the body, is irrational or in a trance,
and that the god, the star who formed its created part,
influences its career, and hence its fortunes may be
predicted by astrological computations; that there are
future rewards and punishments, a residence being appointed
for the righteous in his kindred star; for those
whose lives have been less pure there is a second birth
under the form of a woman, and, if evil courses are still
persisted in, successive transmigrations through various
brutes are in reserve&mdash;the frivolous passing into birds,
the unphilosophical into beasts, the ignorant into fishes;
that the world undergoes periodical revolutions by fire and
water, its destructions and reproductions depending upon
the coincidences of the stars. Of Plato's views of human
physiology I can offer no better statement than the
<span class="sidenote">The physiology of Plato.</span>
following from Ritter: "All in the human body
is formed for the sake of the Reason, after certain
determinate ends. Accordingly, first of all, a seat must
be provided for the god-like portion of the soul, the head,
viz., which is round, and similar to the perfect shape of
the whole, furnished with the organs of cognition, slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
covered with flesh, which impedes the senses. To the
head is given the direction of the whole frame, hence its
position at the top; and, since the animal creation
possesses all the six irregular motions, and the head ought
not to roll upon the ground, the human form is long, with
legs for walking and arms for serving the body, and the
anterior part is fashioned differently from the posterior.
Now, the reason being seated in the head, the spirit or
irascible soul has its seat in the breast, under the head,
in order that it may be within call and command of the
Reason, but yet separated from the head by the neck, that
it might not mix with it. The concupiscible has likewise
its particular seat in the lower part of the trunk, the
abdomen, separated by the diaphragm from that of the
irascible, since it is destined, being separate from both,
to be governed and held in order both by the spirit and
the Reason. For this end God has given it a watch, the
liver, which is dense, smooth, and shining, and, containing
in combination both bitter and sweet, is fitted to receive
and reflect, as a mirror, the images of thoughts. Whenever
the Reason disapproves, it checks inordinate desires by
its bitterness, and, on the other hand, when it approves,
all is soothed into gentle repose by its sweetness; moreover,
in sleep, in sickness, or in inspiration it becomes
prophetic, so that even the vilest portion of the body is in
a certain degree participant of truth. In other respects
the lower portion of the trunk is fashioned with equal
adaptation for the ends it has to serve. The spleen is
placed on the left side of the liver, in order to secrete and
carry off the impurities which the diseases of the body
might produce and accumulate. The intestines are coiled
many times, in order that the food may not pass too quickly
through the body, and so occasion again an immoderate
desire for more; for such a constant appetite would render
the pursuit of philosophy impossible, and make man disobedient
to the commands of the divinity within him."</p>

<div class="sidenote">His ethical ideas.</div>

<p>The reader will gather from the preceding paragraph how
much of wisdom and of folly, of knowledge and of ignorance,
the doctrines of Plato present. I may be permitted
to continue this analysis of his writings a little farther,
with the intention of exhibiting the manner in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
carried his views into practice; for Plato asserted that,
though the supreme good is unattainable by our
reason, we must try to resemble God as far as
it is possible for the changeable to copy the eternal;
remembering that pleasure is not the end of man, and,
though the sensual part of the soul dwells on eating and
drinking, riches and pleasure, and the spiritual on worldly
honours and distinctions, the reason is devoted to knowledge.
Pleasure, therefore, cannot be attributed to the
gods, though knowledge may; pleasure, which is not a
good in itself, but only a means thereto. Each of the
three parts of the soul has its own appropriate virtue, that
of reason being wisdom; that of the spirit, courage; that
of the appetite, temperance; and for the sake of perfection,
justice is added for the mutual regulation of the other
three.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His proposed political institutions.</div>

<p>In carrying his ethical conceptions into practice, Plato
insists that the state is everything, and that
what is in opposition to it ought to be destroyed.
He denies the right of property; strikes at the
very existence of the family, pressing his doctrines
to such an extreme as to consider women as public
property, to be used for the purposes of the state; he
teaches that education should be a governmental duty,
and that religion must be absolutely subjected to the
politician; that children do not belong to their parents,
but to the state; that the aim of government should not
be the happiness of the individual, but that of the whole;
and that men are to be considered not as men, but as
elements of the state, a perfect subject differing from a
slave only in this, that he has the state for his master.
He recommends the exposure of deformed and sickly
infants, and requires every citizen to be initiated into
every species of falsehood and fraud. Distinguishing
between mere social unions and true polities, and insisting
that there should be an analogy between the state and the
soul as respects triple constitution, he establishes a division
of ruler, warriors, and labourers, preferring, therefore, a
monarchy reposing on aristocracy, particularly of talent.
Though he considers music essential to education, his
opinion of the fine arts is so low that he would admit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
into his state painters and musicians only under severe
<span class="sidenote">The Republic of Plato.</span>
restrictions, or not at all. It was for the sake of having
this chimerical republic realized in Sicily that
he made a journey to Dionysius; and it may be
added that it was well for those whom he hoped to have
subjected to the experiment that his wild and visionary
scheme was never permitted to be carried into effect. In
our times extravagant social plans have been proposed,
and some have been attempted; but we have witnessed
nothing so absurd as this vaunted republic of Plato. It
shows a surprising ignorance of the acts and wants of
man in his social condition.</p>

<p>Some of the more important doctrines of Plato are
worthy of further reflection. I shall therefore detain
the reader a short time to offer a few remarks upon them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grandeur of
Plato's conceptions
of God</div>

<p>It was a beautiful conception of this philosophy that
ideas are connected together by others of a higher
order, and these, in their turn, by others still
higher, their generality and power increasing as
we ascend, until finally a culminating point is reached&mdash;a
last, a supreme, an all-ruling idea, which is God. Approaching
in this elevated manner to the doctrine of an Almighty
Being, we are free from those fallacies we are otherwise
liable to fall into when we mingle notions derived from
time and space with the attributes of God; we also avoid
those obscurities necessarily encountered when we attempt
the consideration of the illimitable and eternal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of the soul.</div>

<p>Plato's views of the immortality of the soul offer a
striking contrast to those of the popular philosophy
and superstition of his time. They recall,
in many respects, the doctrines of India. In Greece, those
who held the most enlarged views entertained what might
be termed a doctrine of semi-immortality. They looked for
a continuance of the soul in an endless futurity, but gave
themselves no concern about the eternity which is past.
But Plato considered the soul as having already eternally
existed, the present life being only a moment in our
career; he looked forward with an undoubting faith to
the changes through which we must hereafter pass. As
sparks issue forth from a flame, so doubtless to his
imagination did the soul of man issue forth from the soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the world. Innate ideas and the sentiment of pre-existence
<span class="sidenote">The sentiment of pre-existence.</span>
indicate our past life. By the latter
is meant that on some occasion perhaps of trivial
concern, or perhaps in some momentous event,
it suddenly occurs to us that we have been in like circumstances,
and surrounded by the things at that instant
present on some other occasion before; but the recollection,
though forcibly impressing us with surprise, is
misty and confused. With Plato shall we say it was in one
of our prior states of existence, and the long-forgotten
transactions are now suddenly flashing upon us?</p>

<div class="sidenote">But this arises from the anatomical
construction of the brain.</div>

<p>But Plato did not know the double structure and the
double action of the brain of man; he did not remember
that the mind may lose all recognition of the lapse of
time, and, with equal facility, compress into the twinkling
of an eye events so numerous that for their occurrence
days and even years would seem to be required;
or, conversely, that it can take a single, a simple
idea, which one would suppose might be disposed
of in a moment, and dwell upon it, dilating or
swelling it out, until all the hours of a long
night are consumed. Of the truth of these singular effects
we have not only such testimony as that offered by those
who have been restored from death by drowning, who
describe the flood of memory rushing upon them in the
last moment of their mortal agony, the long train of all
the affairs in which they have borne a part seen in an
instant, as we see the landscape, with all its various
objects, by a flash of lightning at night, and that with
appalling distinctness, but also from our own experience
in our dreams. It is shown in my Physiology how the
phenomena of the sentiment of pre-existence may, upon
these principles, be explained, each hemisphere of the
brain thinking for itself, and the mind deluded as respects
the lapse of time, mistaking these simultaneous actions
for successive ones, and referring one of the two impressions
to an indistinct and misty past. To Plato such
facts as these afforded copious proofs of the prior existence
of the soul, and strong foundations for a faith in its future
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The double immortality,
past and future.</div>

<p>Thus Plato's doctrine of the immortality of the soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
implies a double immortality; the past eternity, as well
as that to come, falls within its scope. In the national
superstition of his time, the spiritual principle
seemed to arise without author or generator,
finding its chance residence in the tabernacle
of the body, growing with its growth and
strengthening with its strength, acquiring for each period
of life a correspondence of form and of feature with its
companion the body, successively assuming the appearance
of the infant, the youth, the adult, the white-bearded
patriarch. The shade who wandered in the Stygian
fields, or stood before the tribunal of Minos to receive his
doom, was thought to correspond in aspect with the
aspect of the body at death. It was thus that Ulysses
recognized the forms of Patroclus and Achilles, and other
heroes of the ten years' siege; it was thus that the
peasant recognized the ghost of his enemy or friend. As
a matter of superstition, these notions had their use, but
in a philosophical sense it is impossible to conceive anything
more defective.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations of the past and
future to man.</div>

<p>Man differs from a lifeless body or a brute in this, that
it is not with the present moment alone that
he has to deal. For the brute the past, when
gone, is clean gone for ever; and the future,
before it approaches, is as if it were never to be. Man,
by his recollection, makes the past a part of the present,
and his foreknowledge adds the future thereto, thereby
uniting the three in one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism on the Ideal theory.</div>

<p>Some of the illustrations commonly given of Plato's
Ideal theory may also be instructively used for
showing the manner in which his facts are
dealt with by the methods of modern science.
Thus Plato would say that there is contained in every
acorn the ideal type of an oak, in accordance with which
as soon as suitable circumstances occur, the acorn will
develop itself into an oak, and into no other tree. In the
act of development of such a seed into its final growth
there are, therefore, two things demanding attention, the
intrinsic character of the seed and the external forces
acting upon it. The Platonic doctrine draws such a
distinction emphatically; its essential purpose is to assert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the absolute existence and independence of that innate
type and its imperishability. Though it requires the
agency of external circumstances for its complete realization,
its being is altogether irrespective of them. There
are, therefore, in such a case, two elements concerned&mdash;an
internal and an external. A like duality is perceived in
many other physiological instances, as in the relationship
of mind and matter, thought and sensation. It is the aim
of the Platonic philosophy to magnify the internal at the
expense of the external in the case of man, thereby
asserting the absolute supremacy of intellect; this being
the particular in which man is distinguished from the
brutes and lower organisms, in whom the external
relatively predominates. The development of any such
organism, be it plant or animal, is therefore nothing but a
manifestation of the Divine idea of Platonism. Many
instances of natural history offer striking illustrations, as
when that which might have been a branch is developed
into a flower, the parts thereof showing a disposition to
arrange themselves by fives or by threes. The persistency
with which this occurs in organisms of the same species,
is, in the Platonic interpretation, a proof that, though
individuals may perish, the idea is immortal. How else,
in this manner, could the like extricate itself from the
unlike; the one deliver itself from, and make itself
manifest among the many?</p>

<p>Such is an instance of Plato's views; but the very
illustration, thus serving to bring them so explicitly
before us, may teach us another, and, perhaps, a more
correct doctrine. For, considering the duality presented
by such cases, the internal and external, the immortal
hidden type and the power acting upon it without, the
character and the circumstances, may we not pertinently
inquire by what authority does Plato diminish the
influence of the latter and enhance the value of the
former? Why are facts to be burdened with such
hypothetical creations, when it is obvious that a much
simpler explanation is sufficient? Let us admit, as our
best physiological views direct, that the starting-point of
every organism, low or high, vegetable or animal, or
whatever else, is a simple cell, the manner of development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of which depends altogether on the circumstances and
influences to which it is exposed; that, so long as those
circumstances are the same the resulting form will be the
same, and that as soon as those circumstances differ the
resulting form differs too. The offspring is like its parent,
not because it includes an immortal typical form, but
because it is exposed in development to the same conditions
as was its parent. Elsewhere I have endeavoured
to show that we must acknowledge this absolute dominion
of physical agents over organic forms as the fundamental
principle in all the sciences of organization; indeed, the
main object of my work on Physiology was to enforce this
very doctrine. But such a doctrine is altogether inconsistent
with the Ideal theory of Platonism. It is no latent
imperishable type existing from eternity that is dominating
in such developments, but they take place as the issue
of a resistless law, variety being possible under variation
of environment. Hence we may perhaps excuse ourselves
from that suprasensual world in which reside typical
forms, universals, ideas of created things, declining this
complex machinery of Platonism, and substituting for it
a simple notion of law. Nor shall we find, if from this
starting-point we direct our thoughts upward, as Plato
did from subordinate ideas to the first idea, anything
incompatible with the noble conclusion to which he eventually
came, anything incompatible with the majesty of God,
whose existence and attributes may be asserted with more
precision and distinctness from considerations of the operation
of immutable law than they can be from the starting-point
of fantastic, imaginary, ideal forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of the Sceptics.</div>

<p>We have seen how the pre-Socratic philosophy ended in
the Sophists; we have now to see how the post-Socratic
ended in the Sceptics. Again was repeated the same result
exhibited in former times, that the doctrines of
the different schools, even those supposed to be
matters of absolute demonstration, were not only essentially
different, but in contradiction to one another. Again,
therefore, the opinion was resumed that the intellect of
man possesses no criterion of truth, being neither able to
distinguish among the contradictions of the impressions of
the senses, nor to judge of the correctness of philosophical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
deductions, nor even to determine the intrinsic morality
of acts. And, if there be no criterion of truth, there can
be no certain ground of science, and there remains nothing
for us but doubt. Such was the conclusion to which
Pyrrho, the founder of the Sceptics, came. He lived about
<small>B.C.</small> 300. His philosophical doctrine of the necessity of
suspending or refusing our assent from want of a criterion
of judgment led by a natural transition to the moral
doctrine that virtue and happiness consist in perfect
quiescence or freedom from all mental perturbation. This
doctrine, it is said, he had learned in India from the Brahmans,
whither he had been in the expedition of Alexander.
On his return to Europe he taught these views in his
school at Elis; but Greek philosophy, in its own order
of advancement, was verging on the discovery of these
conclusions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secondary analysis of
ethical philosophy.</div>

<p>The Sceptical school was thus founded on the assertion
that man can never ascertain the true among phenomena,
and therefore can never know whether things are in
accordance or discordance with their appearances, for the
same object appears differently to us in different positions
and at different times. Doubtless it also appears differently
to various individuals. Among such appearances, how
shall we select the true one, and, if we make a selection,
how shall we be absolutely certain that we are right?
Moreover, the properties we impute to things, such as
colour, smell, taste, hardness, and the like, are dependent
upon our senses; but we very well know that our senses
are perpetually yielding to us contradictory indications,
and it is in vain that we expect Reason to enable
us to distinguish with correctness, or furnish us
a criterion of the truth. The Sceptical school
thus made use of the weapon which the Sophists
had so destructively employed, directing it, however,
chiefly against ethics. But let us ascend a step higher.
If we rely upon Reason, how do we know that Reason itself
is trustworthy? Do we not want some criterion for it? And,
even if such a criterion existed, must we not have for it, in
its turn, some higher criterion? The Sceptic thus justified
his assertion that to man there is no criterion of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrines of Pyrrho.</div>

<p>In accordance with these principles, the Sceptics denied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that we can ever attain to a knowledge of existence from a
knowledge of phenomena. They carried their
doubt to such an extreme as to assert that we
can never know the truth of anything that we have
asserted, no, not even the truth of this very assertion
itself. "We assert nothing," said they; "no, not even
that we assert nothing." They declared that the system of
induction is at best only a system of probability, for an
induction can only be certain when every one and all of
<span class="sidenote">No certainty in knowledge.</span>
the individual things have been examined and demonstrated
to agree with the universal. If one
single exception among myriads of examples be
discovered, the induction is destroyed. But how shall we
be sure, in any one case, that we have examined all the
individuals? therefore we must ever doubt. As to the
method of definitions, it is clear that it is altogether
useless; for, if we are ignorant of a thing, we cannot
define it, and if we know a thing, a definition adds nothing
to our knowledge. In thus destroying definitions and
inductions they destroyed all philosophical method.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrines of Epicurus.</div>

<p>But if there be this impossibility of attaining knowledge,
what is the use of man giving himself any trouble
about the matter? Is it not best to accept life as it comes,
and enjoy pleasure while he may? And this is what
Epicurus, <small>B.C.</small> 342, had already advised men to do. Like
Socrates, he disparages science, and looks upon pleasure
as the main object of life and the criterion of virtue.
Asserting that truth cannot be determined by Reason
alone, he gives up philosophy in despair, or regards it as
an inferior or ineffectual means of contributing to happiness.
In his view the proper division of philosophy is
into Ethics, Canonic, and Physics, the two latter
being of very little importance compared with
the first. The wise man or sage must seek in an Oriental
quietism for the chief happiness of life, indulging himself
in a temperate manner as respects his present appetite,
and adding thereto the recollection of similar sensual
pleasures that are past, and the expectation of new ones
reserved for the future. He must look on philosophy as
the art of enjoying life. He should give himself no concern
as to death or the power of the gods, who are only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
delusion; none as respects a future state, remembering
that the soul, which is nothing more than a congeries of
atoms, is resolved into those constituents at death. There
can be no doubt that such doctrines were very well suited
to the times in which they were introduced; for so great
was the social and political disturbance, so great the uncertainty
of the tenure of property, that it might well be
suggested what better could a man do than enjoy his own
while it was yet in his possession? nor was the inducement
to such a course lessened by extravagant dissipations
when courtesans and cooks, jesters and buffoons, splendid
attire and magnificent appointments had become essential
to life. Demetrius Poliorcetes, who understood the condition
of things thoroughly, says, "There was not, in my
time, in Athens, one great or noble mind." In such a
<span class="sidenote">Tranquil indifference is best for man.</span>
social state, it is not at all surprising that Epicurus had
many followers, and that there were many who agreed
with him in thinking that happiness is best found in a
tranquil indifference, and in believing that there
is nothing in reality good or bad; that it is best
to decide upon nothing, but to leave affairs to
chance; that there is, after all, little or no difference between
life and death: that a wise man will regard philosophy
as an activity of ideas and arguments which may
tend to happiness; that its physical branch is of no other
use than to correct superstitious fancies as to death, and
remove the fear of meteors, prodigies, and other phenomena
by explaining their nature; that the views of Democritus
and Aristotle may be made to some extent available for
the procurement of pleasure; and that we may learn from
the brutes, who pursue pleasure and avoid pain, what
ought to be our course. Upon the whole, it will be found
that there is a connexion between pleasure and virtue,
especially if we enlarge our views and seek for pleasure,
not in the gratification of the present moment, but in the
aggregate offered by existence. The pleasures of the soul
all originate in the pleasures of the flesh; not only those
of the time being, but also those recollected in the past
and anticipated in the future. The sage will therefore
provide for all these, and, remembering that pain is in its
nature transient, but pleasure is enduring, he will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
hesitate to encounter the former if he can be certain that
it will procure him the latter; he will dismiss from his
mind all idle fears of the gods and of destiny, for these are
fictions beneficial only to women and the vulgar; yet,
since they are the objects of the national superstition, it is
needless to procure one's self disfavour by openly deriding
them. It will therefore be better for the sage to treat
them with apparent solemnity, or at least with outward
respect, though he may laugh at the imposition in his
heart. As to the fear of death, he will be especially
careful to rid himself from it, remembering that death is
only a deliverer from the miseries of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imperfections
of the Canonic of Epicurus,</div>

<p>Under the title of Canonic Epicurus delivers his philosophical
views; they are, however, of a very
superficial kind. He insists that our sensuous
impressions are the criterion of truth, and that
even the sensations of a lunatic and a dreamer are true.
But, besides the impressions of the moment, memory is
also to be looked upon as a criterion&mdash;memory, which is
the basis of experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and contradictions of his Physics.</div>

<p>In his Physics he adopts the Atomic theory of Democritus,
though in many respects it ill accords
with his Ethics or Canonic; but so low is his
esteem of its value that he cares nothing for
that. Though atoms and a void are in their nature imperceptible
to the senses, he acknowledges their existence,
asserting the occurrence of an infinite number of atoms of
different kinds in the infinite void, which, because of their
weight, precipitate themselves perpendicularly downward
with an equable motion; but some of them, through an unaccountable
internal force, have deviated from their perpendicular
path, and, sticking together after their collision,
have given rise to the world. Not much better than these
vague puerilities are his notions about the size of the sun,
the nature of eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena;
but he justifies his contradictions and superficiality by
asserting that it is altogether useless for a man to know
such things, and that the sage ought to give himself no
trouble about them. As to the soul, he says that it must
be of a material or corporeal nature, for this simple reason,
that there is nothing incorporeal but a vacuum; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
inclines to the belief that it is a rarefied body, easily
movable, and somewhat of the nature of a vapour; he
divides it into four activities, corresponding to the four
elements entering into its constitution; and that, so far
from being immortal, it is decomposed into its integral
atoms, dying when the body dies. With the atomic
doctrines of Democritus, Epicurus adopts the notions of
that philosopher respecting sensation, to the effect that
eidola or images are sloughed off from all external objects,
and find access to the brain through the eye. In his
theology he admits, under the circumstances we have
mentioned, anthropomorphic gods, pretending to account
for their origin in the chance concourse of atoms, and
<span class="sidenote">His irreligion.</span>
suggesting that they display their quietism and blessedness
by giving themselves no concern about man
or his affairs. By such derisive promptings does
Epicurus mock at the religion of his country&mdash;its rituals,
sacrifices, prayers, and observances. He offers no better
evidence of the existence of God than that there is a
general belief current among men in support of such a
notion; but, when brought to the point, he does not
hesitate to utter his disbelief in the national theology, and
to declare that, in his judgment, it is blind chance that
rules the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Epicureans of modern times.</div>

<p>Such are the opinions to which the name of Epicurus
has been attached; but there were Epicureans ages before
that philosopher was born, and Epicureans there will be
in all time to come. They abound in our own
days, ever characterized by the same features&mdash;an
intense egoism in their social relations, superficiality
in their philosophical views, if the term philosophical can
be justly applied to intellects so narrow; they manifest
an accordance often loud and particular with the religion
of their country, while in their hearts and in their lives
they are utter infidels. These are they who constitute
the most specious part of modern society, and are often
the self-proclaimed guardians of its interests. They are
to be found in every grade of life; in the senate, in the
army, in the professions, and especially in commercial
pursuits, which, unhappily, tend too frequently to the
development of selfishness. It is to them that society is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
indebted for more than half its corruptions, all its hypocrisy,
and more than half its sins. It is they who infuse
into it falsehood as respects the past, imposture as respects
the present, fraud as respects the future; who teach it by
example that the course of a man's life ought to be determined
upon principles of selfishness; that gratitude
and affection are well enough if displayed for effect, but
that they should never be felt; that men are to be looked
upon not as men, but as things to be used; that knowledge
and integrity, patriotism and virtue, are the delusions
of simpletons; and that wealth is the only object
which is really worthy of the homage of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Middle Academy of Arcesilaus.<br /><br />
The New Academy of Carneades.</div>

<p>It now only remains in this chapter to speak of the
later Platonism. The Old Academy, of which Plato was
the founder, limited its labours to the illustration
and defence of his doctrines. The Middle
Academy, originating with Arcesilaus, born
<small>B.C.</small> 316, maintained a warfare with the Stoics, developed
the doctrine of the uncertainty of sensual impressions
and the nothingness of human knowledge. The
New Academy was founded by Carneades, born
<small>B.C.</small> 213, and participated with the preceding
in many of its fundamental positions. On the one side
Carneades leans to scepticism, on the other he accepts
probability as his guide. This school so rapidly degenerated
that at last it occupied itself with rhetoric alone.
The gradual increase of scepticism and indifference
throughout this period is obvious enough; thus Arcesilaus
said that he knew nothing, not even his own ignorance,
and denied both intellectual and sensuous knowledge.
Carneades, obtaining his views from the old philosophy,
found therein arguments suitable for his purpose against
necessity, God, soothsaying; he did not admit that there
is any such thing as justice in the abstract, declaring that
<span class="sidenote">The duplicity of the later Academicians.</span>
it is a purely conventional thing; indeed, it
was his rhetorical display, alternately in praise
of justice and against it, on the occasion of his
visit to Rome, that led Cato to have him expelled from
the city. Though Plato had been the representative of an
age of faith, a secondary analysis of all his works,
implying an exposition of their contradictions, ended in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
scepticism. If we may undertake to determine the precise
aim of a philosophy whose representatives stood in such
an attitude of rhetorical duplicity, it may be said to be
the demonstration that there is no criterion of truth in
this world. Persuaded thus of the impossibility of philosophy,
Carneades was led to recommend his theory of
the probable. "That which has been most perfectly
analyzed and examined, and found to be devoid of
improbability, is the most probable idea." The degeneration
of philosophy now became truly complete, the labours
<span class="sidenote">The fourth and fifth Academies.</span>
of so many great men being degraded to rhetorical and
artistic purposes. It was seen by all that Plato had
destroyed all trust in the indications of the senses, and
substituted for it the Ideal theory. Aristotle had destroyed
that, and there was nothing left to the
world but scepticism. A fourth Academy was
founded by Philo of Larissa, a fifth by Antiochus
of Ascalon. It was reserved for this teacher to
attach the Porch to the Academy, and to merge the
doctrines of Plato in those of the Stoics. Such a heterogeneous
mixture demonstrates the pass to which speculative
philosophy had come, and shows us clearly that her
disciples had abandoned her in despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the Greek age of Faith.</div>

<p>So ends the Greek age of Faith. How strikingly does
its history recall the corresponding period of
individual life&mdash;the trusting spirit and the
disappointment of youth. We enter on it full
of confidence in things and men, never suspecting that
the one may disappoint, the other deceive. Our early
experiences, if considered at all, afford only matter of
surprise that we could ever have been seriously occupied
in such folly, or actuated by motives now seeming so
inadequate. It never occurs to us that, in our present
state, though the pursuits may have changed, they are
none the less vain, the objects none the less delusive.</p>

<p>The second age of Greek philosophy ended in sophism,
the third in scepticism. Speculative philosophy strikes
at last upon a limit which it can not overpass. This is
its state even in our own times. It reverberates against
the wall that confines it without the least chance of
making its way through.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek invasion of Persia.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great is a
most important event in European history. That adventurer,
carrying out the intentions of his father Philip,
commenced his attack with apparently very
insignificant means, having, it is said, at the
most, only thirty-four thousand infantry, four
thousand cavalry, and seventy talents in money. The
result of his expedition was the ruin of the Persian
empire, and also the ruin of Greece. It was not without
reason that his memory was cursed in his native country.
Her life-blood was drained away by his successes. In
view of the splendid fortunes to be made in Asia, Greece
ceased to be the place for an enterprising man. To such
an extent did military emigration go, that Greek recruits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
were settled all over the Persian empire; their number
was sufficient to injure irreparably the country from
which they had parted, but not sufficient to Hellenize the
dense and antique populations among whom they had
settled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its ruinous effect on Greece.</div>

<p>Not only was it thus by the drain of men that the
Macedonian expedition was so dreadfully disastrous to
Greece, the political consequences following
those successful campaigns added to the baneful
result. Alexander could not have more effectually
ruined Athens had he treated her as he did Thebes,
which he levelled with the ground, massacring six
thousand of her citizens, and selling thirty thousand for
slaves. The founding of Alexandria was the commercial
end of Athens, the finishing stroke to her old colonial
system. It might have been well for her had he stopped
<span class="sidenote">Injury to Athens from
the founding of Alexandria.</span>
short in his projects with the downfall of Tyre, destroyed,
not from any vindictive reasons, as is sometimes
said, but because he discovered that that city
was an essential part of the Persian system. It
was never his intention that Athens should
derive advantage from the annihilation of her Ph&oelig;nician
competitor; his object was effectually carried out by the
building and prosperity of Alexandria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific tendency of
the Macedonian campaigns.</div>

<p>Though the military celebrity of this great soldier may
be diminished by the history of the last hundred years,
which shows a uniform result of victory when European
armies are brought in contact with Asiatic, even under
the most extraordinary disadvantages, there cannot be
denied to him a profound sagacity and statesmanship
excelled by no other conqueror. Before he became intoxicated
with success, and, unfortunately, too frequently
intoxicated with wine, there was much that was noble
in his character. He had been under the instruction
of Aristotle for several years, and, on setting out on
his expedition, took with him so many learned men as
almost to justify the remark applied to it, that
it was as much a scientific as a military
undertaking. Among those who thus accompanied
him was Callisthenes, a relative and pupil
of Aristotle, destined for an evil end. Perhaps the assertion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that Alexander furnished to his master 250,000<i>l.</i> and the
services of several thousand men, for the purpose of
obtaining and examining the specimens required in the
composition of his work on the "History of Animals"
may be an exaggeration, but there can be no doubt that
in these transactions was the real beginning of that
policy which soon led to the institution of the Museum at
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the influence of
Aristotle through Alexander.</span>
Alexandria. The importance of this event,
though hitherto little understood, admits of no
exaggeration, so far as the intellectual progress
of Europe is concerned. It gave to the works
of Aristotle their wonderful duration; it imparted to
them not only a Grecian celebrity, but led to their
translation into Syriac by the Nestorians in the fifth
century, and from Syriac by the Arabs into their tongue
four hundred years later. They exercised a living
influence over Christians and Mohammedans indifferently,
from Spain to Mesopotamia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific training and
undertakings of Alexander.</div>

<p>If the letter quoted by Plutarch as having been written
by Alexander to Aristotle be authentic, it not only shows
how thoroughly the pupil had been indoctrinated into the
wisdom of the master, but warns us how liable we are to
be led astray in the exposition we are presently to give of
the Aristotelian philosophy. There was then, as unfortunately
there has been too often since, a private as well as
a public doctrine. Alexander upbraids the philosopher for
his indiscretion in revealing things that it was understood
should be concealed. Aristotle defends himself by asserting
that the desired concealment had not been broken. By
many other incidents of a trifling kind the attachment of
the conqueror to philosophy is indicated; thus Harpalus
and Nearchus, the companions of his youth, were
the agents employed in some of his scientific
undertakings, the latter being engaged in sea
explorations, doubtless having in the main a
political object, yet full of interest to science. Had
Alexander lived, Nearchus was to have repeated the
circumnavigation of Africa. Harpalus, while governor of
Babylon, was occupied in the attempt to exchange the
vegetation of Europe and Asia; he intertransplanted the
productions of Persia and Greece, succeeding, as is related,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in his object of making all European plants that he tried,
except the ivy, grow in Mesopotamia. The journey to the
Caspian Sea, the expedition into the African deserts,
indicate Alexander's personal taste for natural knowledge;
nor is it without significance that, while on his death-bed,
and, indeed, within a few days of his decease, he found
consolation and amusement in having Nearchus by his
side relating the story of his voyages. Nothing shows
more strikingly how correct was his military perception
than the intention he avowed of equipping a thousand
ships for the conquest of Carthage, and thus securing his
supremacy in the Mediterranean. Notwithstanding all
this, there were many points of his character, and many
<span class="sidenote">His unbridled passions and iniquities.</span>
events of his life, worthy of the condemnation with which
they have been visited; the drunken burning
of Persepolis, the prisoners he slaughtered in
honour of Hephæstion, the hanging of Callisthenes,
were the results of intemperance and unbridled
passion. Even so steady a mind as his was incapable of
withstanding the influence of such enormous treasures as
those he seized at Susa; the plunder of the Persian
empire; the inconceivable luxury of Asiatic life; the
uncontrolled power to which he attained. But he was not
so imbecile as to believe himself the descendant of Jupiter
Ammon; that was only an artifice he permitted for the
sake of influencing those around him. We must not
forget that he lived in an age when men looked for
immaculate conceptions and celestial descents. These
Asiatic ideas had made their way into Europe. The
Athenians themselves were soon to be reconciled to the
appointment of divine honours to such as Antigonus and
Demetrius, adoring them as gods&mdash;saviour gods&mdash;and
instituting sacrifices and priests for their worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek age of Reason ushered in.</div>

<p>Great as were the political results of the Macedonian
expedition, they were equalled by the intellectual.
The times were marked by the ushering in of a
new philosophy. Greece had gone through her
age of Credulity, her age of Inquiry, her age of Faith;
she had entered on her age of Reason, and, had freedom of
action been permitted to her, she would have given a
decisive tone to the forthcoming civilization of Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
As will be seen in the following pages, that great destiny
did not await her. From her eccentric position at Alexandria
she could not civilize Europe. In her old
<span class="sidenote">Its inability to accomplish
the civilization of Europe.</span>
age, the power of Europe, concentrated in the
Roman empire, overthrew her. There are very
few histories of the past of more interest to
modern times, and none, unfortunately, more misunderstood,
than this Greek age of Reason manifested at Alexandria.
It illustrates, in the most signal manner, that affairs control
men more than men control affairs. The scientific associations
of the Macedonian conqueror directly arose from the
contemporaneous state of Greek philosophy in the act of
reaching the close of its age of faith, and these influences
ripened under the Macedonian captain who became King
of Egypt. As it was, the learning of Alexandria, though
diverted from its most appropriate and desirable direction
by the operation of the Byzantine system, in the course of
a few centuries acting forcibly upon it, was not without
an influence on the future thought of Europe. Even at
this day Europe will not bear to be fully told how great
that influence has been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings of Aristotle
are its prelude.</div>

<p>The age of Reason, to which Aristotle is about to introduce
us, stands in striking contrast to the preceding ages.
It cannot escape the reader that what was done by the
men of science in Alexandria resembles what is doing in
our own times; their day was the foreshadowing of ours.
And yet a long and dreary period of almost twenty centuries
parts us from them. Politically, Aristotle, through his
friendship with Alexander and the perpetuation
of the Macedonian influence in Ptolemy,
was the connecting link between the Greek age
of Faith and that of Reason, as he was also philosophically
by the nature of his doctrines. He offers us an easy
passage from the speculative methods of Plato to the scientific
methods of Archimedes and Euclid. The copiousness
of his doctrines, and the obscurity of many of them, might,
perhaps, discourage a superficial student, unless he steadily
bears in mind the singular authority they maintained for
so many ages, and the brilliant results in all the exact
parts of human knowledge to which they so quickly led.
The history of Aristotle and his philosophy is therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
our necessary introduction to the grand, the immortal
achievements of the Alexandrian school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biography of Aristotle.</div>

<p>Aristotle was born at Stagira, in Thrace, <small>B.C.</small> 384. His
father was an eminent author of those times on
subjects of Natural History; by profession he
was a physician. Dying while his son was yet quite
young, he bequeathed to him not only very ample means,
but also his own tastes. Aristotle soon found his way to
Athens, and entered the school of Plato, with whom it is
said he remained for nearly twenty years. During this
period he spent most of his patrimony, and in the end was
obliged to support himself by the trade of a druggist. At
length differences arose between them, for, as we shall
soon find, the great pupil was by no means a blind follower
of the great master. In a fortunate moment, Philip, the
King of Macedon, appointed him preceptor to his son
Alexander, an incident of importance in the intellectual
history of Europe. It was to the friendship arising
through this relation that Aristotle owed the assistance
he received from the conqueror during his Asiatic expedition
for the composition of "the Natural History," and also
gained that prestige which gave his name such singular
authority for more than fifteen centuries. He eventually
founded a school in the Lyceum at Athens, and, as it was
his habit to deliver his lectures while walking, his disciples
received the name of Peripatetics, or walking philosophers.
These lectures were of two kinds, esoteric and exoteric, the
former being delivered to the more advanced pupils only.
He wrote a very large number of works, of which about
one-fourth remain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He founds the inductive philosophy.</div>

<p>The philosophical method of Aristotle is the inverse of
that of Plato, whose starting-point was universals,
the very existence of which was a matter
of faith, and from these he descended to particulars
or details. Aristotle, on the contrary, rose from
particulars to universals, advancing to them by inductions;
and his system, thus an inductive philosophy, was in
reality the true beginning of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His method compared with that of Plato.</div>

<p>Plato therefore trusts to the Imagination, Aristotle to
Reason. The contrast between them is best seen by the
attitude in which they stand as respects the Ideal theory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Plato regards universals, types, or exemplars as having an
actual existence; Aristotle declares that they
are mere abstractions of reasoning. For the
fanciful reminiscences derived from former experience
in another life by Plato, Aristotle substitutes the
reminiscences of our actual experience in this. These ideas
of experience are furnished by the memory, which enables
us not only to recall individual facts and events witnessed
by ourselves, but also to collate them with one another,
thereby discovering their resemblances and their differences.
Our induction becomes the more certain as our facts are
more numerous, our experience larger. "Art commences
when, from a great number of experiences, one general
conception is formed which will embrace all similar cases."
"If we properly observe celestial phenomena, we may
demonstrate the laws which regulate them." With Plato,
philosophy arises from faith in the past; with Aristotle,
reason alone can constitute it from existing facts. Plato
is analytic, Aristotle synthetic. The philosophy of Plato
arises from the decomposition of a primitive idea into particulars,
that of Aristotle from the union of particulars
into a general conception. The former is essentially an
idealist, the latter a materialist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The results of Platonism and Aristotelism.</div>

<p>From this it will be seen that the method of Plato
was capable of producing more splendid, though
they were necessarily more unsubstantial results;
that of Aristotle was more tardy in its operation,
but much more solid. It implied endless labour in the
collection of facts, the tedious resort to experiment and
observation, the application of demonstration. In its very
nature it was such that it was impossible for its author to
carry by its aid the structure of science to completion.
The moment that Aristotle applies his own principles we
find him compelled to depart from them through want of
a sufficient experience and sufficient precision in his facts.
The philosophy of Plato is a gorgeous castle in the air,
that of Aristotle is a solid structure, laboriously, and, with
many failures, founded on the solid rock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle's logic</div>

<p>Under Logic, Aristotle treats of the methods of arriving
at general propositions, and of reasoning from them. His
logic is at once the art of thinking and the instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of thought. The completeness of our knowledge depends
on the extent and completeness of our experience.
His manner of reasoning is by the
syllogism, an argument consisting of three propositions,
such that the concluding one follows of necessity from the
two premises, and of which, indeed, the whole theory of
demonstration is only an example. Regarding logic as
the instrument of thought, he introduces into it, as a fundamental
feature, the ten categories. These predicaments
are the genera to which everything may be reduced, and
denote the most general of the attributes which may be
assigned to a thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and metaphysics.</div>

<p>His metaphysics overrides all the branches of the physical
sciences. It undertakes an examination of the postulates
on which each one of them is founded, determining
their truth or fallacy. Considering that
all science must find a support for its fundamental conditions
in an extensive induction from facts, he puts at the
foundation of his system the consideration of the individual;
in relation to the world of sense, he regards four causes as
necessary for the production of a fact&mdash;the material cause,
the substantial cause, the efficient cause, the final cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temporary failure of his system.</div>

<p>But as soon as we come to the Physics of Aristotle we
see at once his weakness. The knowledge of his
age does not furnish him facts enough whereon
to build, and the consequence is that he is forced
into speculation. It will be sufficient for our purpose to
allude to a few of his statements, either in this or in his
metaphysical branch, to show how great is his uncertainty
and confusion. Thus he asserts that matter contains a
triple form&mdash;simple substance, higher substance, which is
eternal, and absolute substance, or God himself; that the
universe is immutable and eternal, and, though in relation
<span class="sidenote">The Peripatetic philosophy.<br /><br />
Substance, Motion, Space, Time.</span>
with the vicissitudes of the world, it is unaffected
thereby; that the primitive force which gives
rise to all the motions and changes we see is
Nature; it also gives rise to Rest; that the world is a
living being, having a soul; that, since every
thing is for some particular end, the soul of man
is the end of his body; that Motion is the condition
of all nature; that the world has a definite boundary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and a limited magnitude; that Space is the immovable
vessel in which whatever is may be moved; that Space,
as a whole, is without motion, though its parts may move;
that it is not to be conceived of as without contents; that
it is impossible for a vacuum to exist, and hence there is
not beyond and surrounding the world a void which contains
the world; that there could be no such thing as
Time unless there is a soul, for time being the number of
motion, number is impossible except there be one who
numbers; that, perpetual motion in a finite right line
<span class="sidenote">The world.</span>
being impossible, but in a curvilinear path possible, the
world, which is limited and ever in motion, must
be of a spherical form; that the earth is its
central part, the heavens the circumferential: hence the
heaven is nearest to the prime cause of motion; that the
orderly, continuous, and unceasing movement of the celestial
bodies implies an unmoved mover, for the unchangeable
alone can give birth to uniform motion; that unmoved
existence is God; that the stars are passionless beings,
having attained the end of existence, and worthy above
other things of human adoration; that the fixed stars are
in the outermost heaven, and the sun, moon, and planets
beneath: the former receive their motion from the prime
moving cause, but the planets are disturbed by the stars;
that there are five elements&mdash;earth, air, fire, water, and
ether; that the earth is in the centre of the world, since
earthy matter settles uniformly round a central point;
that fire seeks the circumferential region, and intermediately
water floats upon the earth, and air upon water;
that the elements are transmutable into one another, and
hence many intervening substances arise; that each sphere
is in interconnection with the others; the earth is agitated
and disturbed by the sea, the sea by the winds, which are
movements of the air, the air by the sun, moon, and
planets. Each inferior sphere is controlled by its outlying
or superior one, and hence it follows that the earth, which
is thus disturbed by the conspiring or conflicting action of
all above it, is liable to the most irregularities; that, since
animals are nourished by the earth, it needs must enter
into their composition, but that water is required to hold
the earthy matters together; that every element must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
looked upon as living, since it is pervaded by the soul of
the world; that there is an unbroken chain from the
simple element through the plant and animal up to man,
<span class="sidenote">Organic beings.</span>
the different groups merging by insensible shades into one
another: thus zoophytes partake partly of the
vegetable and partly of the animal, and serve as
an intermedium between them; that plants are inferior to
animals in this, that they do not possess a single principle
of life or soul, but many subordinate ones, as is shown by
the circumstance that, when they are cut to pieces, each
piece is capable of perfect or independent growth or life.
Their inferiority is likewise betrayed by their belonging
especially to the earth to which they are rooted, each root
being a true mouth; and this again displays their lowly
position, for the place of the mouth is ever an indication
of the grade of a creature: thus in man, who is at the
head of the scale, it is in the upper part of the body; that
in proportion to the heat of an animal is its grade higher;
thus those that are aquatic are cold, and therefore of very
little intelligence, and the same maybe said of plants; but
of man, whose warmth is very great, the soul is much
more excellent; that the possession of locomotion by an
organism always implies the possession of sensation; that
the senses of taste and touch indicate the qualities of things
in contact with the organs of the animal, but that those of
<span class="sidenote">Physiological conclusions.</span>
smell, hearing, and sight extend the sphere of its existence,
and indicate to it what is at a distance: that the place of
reception of the various sensations is the soul,
from which issue forth the motions; that the
blood, as the general element of nutrition, is essential to
the support of the body, though insensible itself: it is also
essential to the activity of the soul; that the brain is not the
recipient of sensations: that function belongs to the heart;
all the animal activities are united in the last; it contains
the principle of life, being the principle of motion: it is
the first part to be formed and the last to die; that the
brain is a mere appendix to the heart, since it is formed
after the heart, is the coldest of the organs and is devoid
of blood; that the soul is the reunion of all the functions
of the body: it is an energy or active essence; being
neither body nor magnitude, it cannot have extension, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
thought has no parts, nor can it be said to move in space;
it is as a sailor, who is motionless in a ship which is moving;
that, in the origin of the organism, the male furnishes the
soul and the female the body; that the body being liable
to decay, and of a transitory nature, it is necessary for its
well-being that its disintegration and nutrition should
balance one another; that sensation may be compared to
the impression of a seal on wax, the wax receiving form
only, but no substance or matter; that imagination arises
from impressions thus made, which endure for a length of
time, and that this is the origin of memory; that man
alone possesses recollection, but animals share with him
memory&mdash;memory being unintentional or spontaneous,
but recollection implying voluntary exertion or a search;
that recollection is necessary for acting with design. It is
doubtful whether Aristotle believed in the immortality of
the soul, no decisive passage to that effect occurring in
such of his works as are extant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of Aristotle's
success and failure.</div>

<p>Aristotle, with a correct and scientific method, tried to
build up a vast system when he was not in possession of
the necessary data. Though a very learned man,
he had not sufficient knowledge; indeed, there
was not sufficient knowledge at that time in the
world. For many of the assertions I have quoted
in the preceding paragraph there was no kind of proof;
many of them also, such as the settling of the heavy and
the rise of the light, imply very poor cosmic ideas. It is
not until he deals with those branches, such as comparative
anatomy and natural history, of which he had a personal
and practical knowledge, that he begins to write well. Of
his physiological conclusions, some are singularly felicitous;
his views of the connected chain of organic forms, from the
lowest to the highest, are very grand. His metaphysical
and physical speculations&mdash;for in reality they are nothing
but speculations&mdash;are of no kind of value. His successful
achievements, and also his failures, conspicuously prove the
excellence of his system. He expounded the true principles
of science, but failed to apply them merely for want
of materials. His ambition could not brook restraint. He
would rather attempt to construct the universe without
the necessary means than not construct it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Aristotle failed when he abandoned his own principles,
and the magnitude of his failure proves how just his
principles were; he succeeded when he adhered to them.
If anything were wanting to vindicate their correctness
and illustrate them, it is supplied by the glorious achievements
of the Alexandrian school, which acted in physical
science as Aristotle had acted in natural history, laying a
basis solidly in observation and experiment, and accomplishing
a like durable and brilliant result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biography of Zeno.</div>

<p>From Aristotle it is necessary to turn to Zeno, for the
Peripatetics and Stoics stand in parallel lines. The social
conditions existing in Greece at the time of
Epicurus may in some degree palliate his
sentiments, but virtue and honour will make themselves
felt at last. Stoicism soon appeared as the antagonist of
Epicureanism, and Epicurus found in Zeno of Citium a
rival. The passage from Epicurus to Zeno is the passage
from sensual gratification to self-control.</p>

<p>The biography of Zeno may be dismissed in a few words.
Born about <small>B.C.</small> 300, he spent the early part of his life in
the vocation of his father, who was a merchant, but, by a
fortunate shipwreck, happily losing his goods during a
voyage he was making to Athens, he turned to philosophy
for consolation. Though he had heretofore been somewhat
acquainted with the doctrines of Socrates, he became a
disciple of the Cynics, subsequently studying in the
Megaric school, and then making himself acquainted with
Platonism. After twenty years of preparation, he opened
a school in the stoa or porch in Athens, from which his
doctrine and disciples have received their name. He presided
over his school for fifty-eight years, numbering many
eminent men among his disciples. When nearly a hundred
years old he chanced to fall and break his finger, and,
receiving this as an admonition that his time was accomplished,
he forthwith strangled himself. The Athenians
erected to his memory a statue of brass. His doctrines long
survived him, and, in times when there was no other consolation
for man, offered a support in their hour of trial, and
an unwavering guide in the vicissitudes of life, not only
to many illustrious Greeks, but also to some of the great
philosophers, statesmen, generals, and emperors of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intention of Stoicism.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
It was the intention of Zeno to substitute for the
visionary speculations of Platonism a system directed to
the daily practices of life, and hence dealing
chiefly with morals. To make men virtuous was
his aim. But this is essentially connected with knowledge,
for Zeno was persuaded that if we only know what is good
we shall be certain to practise it. He therefore rejected
Plato's fancies of Ideas and Reminiscences, leaning to the
common-sense doctrines of Aristotle, to whom he approached
in many details. With him Sense furnishes the data of
knowledge, and Reason combines them: the soul being
modified by external things, and modifying them in return,
he believed that the mind is at first, as it were, a blank
tablet, on which sensation writes marks, and that the distinctness
of sensuous impressions is the criterion of their
truth. The changes thus produced in the soul constitute
ideas; but, with a prophetic inspiration, he complained that
man will never know the true essence of things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Physics of Zeno.</div>

<p>In his Physics Zeno adopted the doctrine of Strato, that
the world is a living being. He believed that
nothing incorporeal can produce an effect, and
hence that the soul is corporeal. Matter and its properties
he considered to be absolutely inseparable, a property being
actually a body. In the world there are two things,
matter and God, who is the Reason of the world. Essentially,
however, God and matter are the same thing, which assumes
the aspect of matter from the passive point of view,
and God from the active; he is, moreover, the prime
moving force, Destiny, Necessity, a life-giving Soul,
evolving things as the vital force evolves a plant out of a
seed; the visible world is thus to be regarded as the
material manifestation of God. The transitory objects
which it on all sides presents will be reabsorbed after a
season of time, and reunited in him. The Stoics pretended
to indicate, even in a more definite manner, the process by
which the world has arisen, and also its future destiny;
for, regarding the Supreme as a vital heat, they supposed
that a portion of that fire, declining in energy, became
transmuted into matter, and hence the origin of the world;
but that that fire, hereafter resuming its activity, would
cause a universal conflagration, the end of things. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the present state everything is in a condition of uncertain
mutation, decays being followed by reproductions, and reproductions
by decays; and, as a cataract shows from year
to year an invariable form, though the water composing it
is perpetually changing, so the objects around us are
nothing more than a flux of matter offering a permanent
form. Thus the visible world is only a moment in the life
of God, and after it has vanished away like a scroll that
is burned, a new period shall be ushered in, and a new
heaven and a new earth, exactly like the ancient ones, shall
arise. Since nothing can exist without its contrary, no
injustice unless there was justice, no cowardice unless there
was courage, no lie unless there was truth, no shadow
unless there was light, so the existence of good necessitates
that of evil. The Stoics believed that the development of
the world is under the dominion of paramount law, supreme
law, Destiny, to which God himself is subject, and that
hence he can only develop the world in a predestined way,
as the vital warmth evolves a seed into the predestined form
of a plant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exoteric philosophy of the Stoics.</div>

<p>The Stoics held it indecorous to offend needlessly the
religious ideas of the times, and, indeed, they
admitted that there might be created gods like
those of Plato; but they disapproved of the
adoration of images and the use of temples, making amends
for their offences in these particulars by offering a semi-philosophical
interpretation of the legends, and demonstrating
that the existence, and even phenomenal display
of the gods was in accordance with their principles.
Perhaps to this exoteric philosophy we must ascribe the
manner in which they expressed themselves as to final
causes&mdash;expressions sometimes of amusing quaintness&mdash;thus,
that the peacock was formed for the sake of his tail,
and that a soul was given to the hog instead of salt, to
prevent his body from rotting; that the final cause of
plants is to be food for brutes, of brutes to be food for men,
though they discreetly checked their irony in its ascending
career, and abstained from saying that men are food for
the gods, and the gods for all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their opinions of the nature of the soul.</div>

<p>The Stoics concluded that the soul is mere warm breath,
and that it and the body mutually interpervade one another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
They thought that it might subsist after death until the
general conflagration, particularly if its energy
were great, as in the strong spirits of the virtuous
and wise. Its unity of action implies that it
has a principle of identity, the I, of which the physiological
seat is the heart. Every appetite, lust, or desire is
an imperfect knowledge. Our nature and properties are
forced upon us by Fate, but it is our duty to despise all
our propensities and passions, and to live so that we may
be free, intelligent, and virtuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their ethical rules of wisdom.</div>

<p>This sentiment leads us to the great maxim of Stoical
Ethics, "Live according to Reason;" or, since the world is
composed of matter and God, who is the Reason of the
world, "Live in harmony with Nature." As Reason is
supreme in Nature, it ought to be so in man. Our existence
should be intellectual, and all bodily pains
and pleasures should be despised. A harmony
between the human will and universal Reason
constitutes virtue. The free-will of the sage should guide
his actions in the same irresistible manner in which
universal Reason controls nature. Hence the necessity of
a cultivation of physics, without which we cannot distinguish
good from evil. The sage is directed to remember
that Nature, in her operations, aims at the universal, and
never spares individuals, but uses them as means for accomplishing
her ends. It is for him, therefore, to submit
to his destiny, endeavouring continually to establish the
supremacy of Reason, and cultivating, as the things necessary
to virtue, knowledge, temperance, fortitude, justice.
He is at liberty to put patriotism at the value it is worth
when he remembers that he is a citizen of the world; he
must train himself to receive in tranquillity the shocks of
Destiny, and to be above all passion and all pain. He
must never relent and never forgive. He must remember
that there are only two classes of men, the wise and the
fools, as "sticks can only either be straight or crooked, and
very few sticks in this world are absolutely straight."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">Rise of Greek science.<br /><br />
Political position of the Ptolemies.</div>

<p>From the account I have given of Aristotle's philosophy,
it may be seen that he occupied a middle ground between
the speculation of the old philosophy and the strict science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of the Alexandrian school. He is the true connecting
link, in the history of European intellectual
progress, between philosophy and science. Under
his teaching, and the material tendencies of the Macedonian
campaigns, there arose a class of men in Egypt who gave
to the practical a development it had never before attained;
for that country, upon the breaking up of Alexander's
dominion, <small>B.C.</small> 323, falling into the possession of Ptolemy,
that general found himself at once the depositary
of spiritual and temporal power. Of the
former, it is to be remembered that, though the
conquest by Cambyses had given it a severe shock, it still
not only survived, but displayed no inconsiderable tokens
of strength. Indeed, it is well known that the surrender
of Egypt to Alexander was greatly accelerated by hatred
to the Persians, the Egyptians welcoming the Macedonians
as their deliverers. In this movement we perceive at
once the authority of the old priesthood. It is hard to
tear up by the roots an ancient religion, the ramifications
of which have solidly insinuated themselves among a
populace. That of Egypt had already been the growth of
more than three thousand years. The question for the intrusive
Greek sovereigns to solve was how to co-ordinate
this hoary system with the philosophical scepticism
<span class="sidenote">They co-ordinate Egyptian
idolatry and Greek scepticism.</span>
that had issued as the result of Greek
thought. With singular sagacity, they saw
that this might be accomplished by availing
themselves of Orientalism, the common point of contact of
the two systems; and that, by its formal introduction and
development, it would be possible not only to enable the
philosophical king, to whom all the pagan gods were alike
equally fictitious and equally useful, to manifest respect
even to the ultra-heathenish practices of the Egyptian
populace, but, what was of far more moment, to establish
an apparent concord between the old sacerdotal Egyptian
party&mdash;strong in its unparalleled antiquity; strong in its
reminiscences; strong in its recent persecutions; strong in
its Pharaonic relics, regarded by all men with a superstitious
or reverent awe&mdash;and the free-thinking and
versatile Greeks. The occasion was like some others in
history, some even in our own times; a small but energetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
body of invaders was holding in subjection an ancient and
populous country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Museum of Alexandria.</div>

<p>To give practical force to this project, a grand state
institution was founded at Alexandria. It became
celebrated as the Museum. To it, as to a
centre, philosophers from all parts of the world
converged. It is said that at one time not less than fourteen
thousand students were assembled there. Alexandria, in
confirmation of the prophetic foresight of the great soldier
who founded it, quickly became an immense metropolis,
abounding in mercantile and manufacturing activity. As
is ever the case with such cities, its higher classes were
prodigal and dissipated, its lower only to be held in
restraint by armed force. Its public amusements were
such as might be expected&mdash;theatrical shows, music, horse-racing.
In the solitude of such a crowd, or in the noise
of such dissipation, anyone could find a retreat&mdash;atheists
who had been banished from Athens, devotees from the
Ganges, monotheistic Jews, blasphemers from Asia Minor.
Indeed, it has been said that in this heterogeneous community
blasphemy was hardly looked upon as a crime; at
the worst, it was no more than an unfortunate, and, it
might be, an innocent mistake. But, since uneducated
men need some solid support on which their thoughts may
rest, mere abstract doctrines not meeting their wants, it
became necessary to provide a corporeal representation
<span class="sidenote">Establishment of the worship
of Serapis.</span>
for this eclectic philosophical Pantheism, and hence the
Ptolemies were obliged to restore, or, as some
say, to import the worship of the god Serapis.
Those who affirm that he was imported say that
he was brought from Sinope; modern Egyptian scholars,
however, give a different account. As setting forth the
Pantheistic doctrine of which he was the emblem, his
image, subsequently to attain world-wide fame, was made
of all kinds of metals and stones. "All is God." But
still the people, with that instinct which other nations and
ages have displayed, hankered after a female divinity, and
this led to the partial restoration of the worship of Isis. It
is interesting to remark how the humble classes never
shake off the reminiscences of early life, leaning rather to
the maternal than to the paternal attachment. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it is for that reason that they expect a more favourable
attention to their supplications from a female divinity
than a god. Accordingly, the devotees of Isis soon out-numbered
those of Serapis, though a magnificent temple
had been built for him at Rhacotis, in the quarter adjoining
the Museum, and his worship was celebrated with more
than imperial splendour. In subsequent ages the worship
of Serapis diffused itself throughout the Roman empire,
though the authorities&mdash;consuls, senate, emperors&mdash;knowing
well the idea it foreshadowed, and the doctrine it was
meant to imply, used their utmost power to put it down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Alexandrian libraries.</div>

<p>The Alexandrian Museum soon assumed the character of
a University. In it those great libraries were collected,
the pride and boast of antiquity. Demetrius Phalareus
was instructed to collect all the writings in
the world. So powerfully were the exertions
of himself and his successors enforced by the government
that two immense libraries were procured. They
contained 700,000 volumes. In this literary and scientific
retreat, supported in ease and even in luxury&mdash;luxury, for
allusions to the sumptuous dinners have descended to our
times&mdash;the philosophers spent their time in mental culture
by study, or mutual improvement by debates. The king
himself conferred appointments to these positions; in later
times, the Roman emperors succeeded to the patronage, the
government thereby binding in golden chains intellect
that might otherwise have proved troublesome. At first,
in honour of the ancient religion, the presidency of the
establishment was committed to an Egyptian priest; but
in the course of time that policy was abandoned. It must
not, however, be imagined that the duties of the inmates
were limited to reading and rhetorical display; a far more
<span class="sidenote">Botanical gardens; menageries;
dissecting-houses; observatories.</span>
practical character was imparted to them. A
botanical garden, in connection with the Museum,
offered an opportunity to those who were interested
in the study of the nature of plants; a
zoological menagerie afforded like facilities to
those interested in animals. Even these costly establishments
were made to minister to the luxury of the times: in
the zoological garden pheasants were raised for the royal
table. Besides these elegant and fashionable appointments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
another, of a more forbidding and perhaps repulsive kind,
was added; an establishment which, in the light of
our times, is sufficient to confer immortal glory on those
illustrious and high-minded kings, and to put to shame
the ignorance and superstition of many modern nations: it
was an anatomical school, suitably provided with means
for the dissection of the human body, this anatomical
school being the basis of a medical college for the education
of physicians. For the astronomers Ptolemy Euergetes
placed in the Square Porch an equinoctial and a solstitial
armil, the graduated limbs of these instruments being
divided into degrees and sixths. There were in the
observatory stone quadrants, the precursors of our mural
quadrants. On the floor a meridian line was drawn for the
adjustment of the instruments. There were also astrolabes
and dioptras. Thus, side by side, almost in the king's
palace, were noble provisions for the cultivation of exact
science and for the pursuit of light literature. Under the
same roof were gathered together geometers, astronomers,
chemists, mechanicians, engineers. There were also poets,
who ministered to the literary wants of the dissipated
city&mdash;authors who could write verse, not only in correct
<span class="sidenote">Life in the Museum.</span>
metre, but in all kinds of fantastic forms&mdash;trees, hearts,
and eggs. Here met together the literary dandy
and the grim theologian. At their repasts occasionally
the king himself would preside, enlivening the
moment with the condescensions of royal relaxation. Thus,
of Philadelphus it is stated that he caused to be presented
to the Stoic Sphærus a dish of fruit made of wax, so beautifully
coloured as to be undistinguishable from the natural,
and on the mortified philosopher detecting too late the fraud
that had been practised upon him, inquired what he now
thought of the maxim of his sect that "the sage is never
deceived by appearances." Of the same sovereign it is related
that he received the translators of the Septuagint
Bible with the highest honours, entertaining them at his
table. Under the atmosphere of the place their usual
religious ceremonial was laid aside, save that the king
courteously requested one of the aged priests to offer an
extempore prayer. It is naively related that the Alexandrians
present, ever quick to discern rhetorical merit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
testified their estimation of the performance with loud
applause. But not alone did literature and the exact
sciences thus find protection. As if no subjects with which
the human mind has occupied itself can be unworthy of
investigation, in the Museum were cultivated the more
doubtful arts, magic and astrology. Philadelphus, who,
toward the close of his life, was haunted with an intolerable
dread of death, devoted himself with intense assiduity to
the discovery of the elixir of life and to alchemy. Such a
comprehensive organization for the development of human
knowledge never existed in the world before, and, considering
the circumstances, never has since. To be connected
with it was the passport to the highest Alexandrian society
and to court favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Septuagint translators.</div>

<p>To the Museum, and, it has been asserted, particularly to
Ptolemy Philadelphus, the Christian world is thus under
obligation for the ancient version of the Hebrew Scriptures&mdash;the
Septuagint. Many idle stories have been
related respecting the circumstances under which
that version was made, as that the seventy-two
translators by whom it was executed were confined each in
a separate cell, and, when their work was finished, the
seventy-two copies were found identically the same, word
for word, from this it was supposed that the inspiration
of this translation was established. If any proof of that
kind were needed, it would be much better found in
the fact that whenever occasion arises in the New Testament
of quoting from the Old, it is usually done in the
words of the Septuagint. The story of the cells underwent
successive improvements among the early fathers, but is
now rejected as a fiction; and, indeed, it seems probable
that the translation was not made under the splendid
circumstances commonly related, but merely by the Alexandrian
Jews for their own convenience. As the Septuagint
grew into credit among the Christians, it lost favour among
the Jews, who made repeated attempts in after years to
supplant it by new versions, such as those of Aquila, of
Theodotion, of Symmachus, and others. From the first the
Syrian Jews had looked on it with disapproval; they even
held the time of its translation as a day of mourning, and
with malicious grief pointed out its errors, as, for instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
they affirmed that it made Methusaleh live until after the
Deluge. Ptolemy treated all those who were concerned in
providing books for the library with consideration, remunerating
his translators and transcribers in a princely
manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lasting influence of the Museum,
theological and scientific.</div>

<p>But the modern world is not indebted to these Egyptian
kings only in the particular here referred
to. The Museum made an impression upon the
intellectual career of Europe so powerful and
enduring that we still enjoy its results. That
impression was twofold, theological and physical. The
dialectical spirit and literary culture diffused among the
Alexandrians prepared that people, beyond all others, for
the reception of Christianity. For thirty centuries the
Egyptians had been familiar with the conception of a
triune God. There was hardly a city of any note without
its particular triad. Here it was Amun, Maut, and
Khonso; there Osiris, Isis, and Horus. The apostolic
missionaries, when they reached Alexandria, found a people
ready to appreciate the profoundest mysteries. But with
these advantages came great evils. The Trinitarian disputes,
which subsequently deluged the world with blood, had
their starting-point and focus in Alexandria. In that city
Arius and Athanasius dwelt. There originated that
desperate conflict which compelled Constantine the Great
to summon the Council of Nicea, to settle, by a formulary
or creed, the essentials of our faith.</p>

<p>But it was not alone as regards theology that Alexandria
exerted a power on subsequent ages; her influence was as
strongly marked in the impression it gave to science.
Astronomical observatories, chemical laboratories, libraries,
dissecting-houses, were not in vain. There went forth
from them a spirit powerful enough to tincture all future
times. Nothing like the Alexandrian Museum was ever
called into existence in Greece or Rome, even in their
palmiest days. It is the unique and noble memorial of the
dynasty of the Ptolemies, who have thereby laid the whole
human race under obligations, and vindicated their title to
be regarded as a most illustrious line of kings. The
Museum was, in truth, an attempt at the organization of
human knowledge, both for its development and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
diffusion. It was conceived and executed in a practical
manner worthy of Alexander. And though, in the night
through which Europe has been passing&mdash;a night full of
dreams and delusions&mdash;men have not entertained a right
estimate of the spirit in which that great institution was
founded, and the work it accomplished, its glories being
eclipsed by darker and more unworthy things, the time is
approaching when its action on the course of human events
will be better understood, and its influences on European
civilization more clearly discerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Museum was the issue
of the Macedonian campaigns.</div>

<p>Thus, then, about the beginning of the third century
before Christ, in consequence of the Macedonian campaign,
which had brought the Greeks into contact with
the ancient civilization of Asia, a great degree
of intellectual activity was manifested in Egypt.
On the site of the village of Rhacotis, once held
as an Egyptian post to prevent the ingress of strangers,
the Macedonians erected that city which was to be the
entrepôt of the commerce of the East and West, and to
transmit an illustrious name to the latest generations.
Her long career of commercial prosperity, her commanding
position as respects the material interests of the world,
justified the statesmanship of her founder, and the intellectual
glory which has gathered round her has given an
enduring lustre to his name.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the philosophical activity
here alluded to was the direct issue of the political and
military event to which we have referred it. The tastes
and genius of Alexander were manifested by his relations
to Aristotle, whose studies in natural history he promoted
by the collection of a menagerie; and in astronomy, by
transmitting to him, through Callisthenes, the records of
Babylonian observations extending over 1903 years. His
biography, as we have seen, shows a personal interest in
the cultivation of such studies. In this particular other
great soldiers have resembled him; and perhaps it may be
inferred that the practical habit of thought and accommodation
of theory to the actual purposes of life pre-eminently
required by their profession, leads them spontaneously
to decline speculative uncertainties, and to be
satisfied only with things that are real and exact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Under the inspiration of the system of Alexander, and
guided by the suggestions of certain great men who had
caught the spirit of the times, the Egyptian kings thus
created, under their own immediate auspices, the Museum.
State policy, operating in the manner I have previously
described, furnished them with an additional theological
reason for founding this establishment. In the Macedonian
campaign a vast amount of engineering and mathematical
talent had been necessarily stimulated into existence, for
great armies cannot be handled, great marches cannot be
made, nor great battles fought without that result. When
the period of energetic action was over, and to the military
operations succeeded comparative repose and temporary
moments of peace, the talent thus called forth found
occupation in the way most congenial to it by cultivating
mathematical and physical studies. In Alexandria, itself
a monument of engineering and architectural skill, soon
were to be found men whose names were destined for
<span class="sidenote">The great men it produced.</span>
futurity&mdash;Apollonius, Eratosthenes, Manetho. Of these,
one may be selected for the remark that, while
speculative philosophers were occupying themselves
with discussions respecting the criterion of
truth, and, upon the whole, coming to the conclusion that no
such thing existed, and that, if the truth was actually in the
possession of man, he had no means of knowing it, Euclid
of Alexandria was writing an immortal work, destined to
challenge contradiction from the whole human race, and to
make good its title as the representative of absolute and
undeniable truth&mdash;truth not to be gainsaid in any nation
or at any time. We still use the geometry of Euclid in
our schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings of Euclid.</div>

<p>It is said that Euclid opened a geometrical school in
Alexandria about <small>B.C.</small> 300. He occupied himself not only
with mathematical, but also with physical investigation.
Besides many works of the former class supposed
to have been written by him, as on Fallacies,
Conic Sections, Divisions, Porisms, Data, there are imputed
to him treatises on Harmonics, Optics, and Catoptrics, the
two latter subjects being discussed, agreeably to the views of
those times, on the hypothesis of rays issuing from the eye
to the object, instead of passing, as we consider them to do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
from the object to the eye. It is, however, on the excellencies
of his Elements of Geometry that the durable
reputation of Euclid depends; and though the hypercriticism
of modern mathematicians has perhaps successfully
maintained such objections against them as that they
might have been more precise in their axioms, that they
sometimes assume what might be proved, that they are
occasionally redundant, and their arrangement sometimes
imperfect, yet they still maintain their ground as a model
of extreme accuracy, of perspicuity, and as a standard of
exact demonstration. They were employed universally by
the Greeks, and, in subsequent ages, were translated and
preserved by the Arabs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings and works of Archimedes.</div>

<p>Great as is the fame of Euclid, it is eclipsed by that of
Archimedes the Syracusan, born <small>B.C.</small> 287, whose
connection with Egyptian science is not alone
testified by tradition, but also by such facts as
his acknowledged friendship with Conon of Alexandria,
and his invention of the screw still bearing his name,
intended for raising the waters of the Nile. Among his
mathematical works, the most interesting, perhaps, in his
own estimation, as we may judge from the incident that he
directed the diagram thereof to be engraved on his tombstone,
was his demonstration that the solid content of a
sphere is two-thirds that of its circumscribing cylinder.
It was by this mark that Cicero, when Quæstor of Sicily,
discovered the tomb of Archimedes grown over with weeds.
This theorem was, however, only one of a large number of
a like kind, which he treated of in his two books on the
sphere and cylinder in an equally masterly manner, and
with equal success. His position as a geometer is perhaps
better understood from the assertion made respecting him
by a modern mathematician, that he came as near to the
discovery of the Differential Calculus as can be done
without the aid of algebraic transformations. Among the
special problems he treated of may be mentioned the
quadrature of the circle, his determination of the ratio of
the circumference to the diameter being between: 3·1428
and 3·1408, the true value, as is now known, being 3·1416
nearly. He also wrote on Conoids and Spheroids, and upon
that spiral still passing under his name, the genesis of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had been suggested to him by Conon. In his work entitled
"Psammites" he alludes to the astronomical system subsequently
established by Copernicus, whose name has been
given to it. He also mentions the attempts which had
been made to measure the size of the earth; the chief
object of the work being, however, to prove not only that
the sands upon the sea-shore can be numbered, but even
those required to fill the entire space within the sphere of
the fixed stars; the result being, according to our system
of arithmetic, a less number than is expressed by unity
followed by 63 ciphers. Such a book is the sport of a
geometrical giant wantonly amusing himself with his
strength. Among his mathematical investigations must
not be omitted the quadrature of the parabola. His fame
depends, however, not so much on his mathematical
triumphs as upon his brilliant discoveries in physics and
his mechanical inventions. How he laid the foundation
of Hydrostatics is familiar to everyone, through the story
of Hiero's crown. A certain artisan having adulterated
the gold given him by King Hiero to form a crown,
Archimedes discovered while he was accidentally stepping
into a bath, that the falsification might be detected, and
thereby invented the method for the determination of
specific gravity. From these investigations he was
naturally led to the consideration of the equilibrium of
floating bodies; but his grand achievement in the
mechanical direction was his discovery of the true theory
of the lever: his surprising merit in these respects is demonstrated
by the fact that no advance was made in theoretical
mechanics during the eighteen centuries intervening
between him and Leonardo da Vinci. Of minor matters
not fewer than forty mechanical inventions have been
attributed to him. Among these are the endless screw,
the screw pump, a hydraulic organ, and burning mirrors.
His genius is well indicated by the saying popularly attributed
to him, "Give me whereon to stand, and I will
move the earth," and by the anecdotes told of his exertions
against Marcellus during the siege of Syracuse; his
invention of catapults and other engines for throwing
projectiles, as darts and heavy stones, claws which,
reaching over the walls, lifted up into the air ships and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their crews, and then suddenly dropped them into the sea;
burning mirrors, by which, at a great distance, the Roman
fleet was set on fire. It is related that Marcellus, honouring
his intellect, gave the strictest orders that no harm should
be done to him at the taking of the town, and that he was
killed, unfortunately, by an ignorant soldier&mdash;unfortunately,
for Europe was not able to produce his equal for
nearly two thousand years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings and works of Eratosthenes.</div>

<p>Eratosthenes was contemporary with Archimedes. He
was born at Cyrene, <small>B.C.</small> 276. The care of the library
appears to have been committed to him by
Euergetes; but his attention was more specially
directed to mathematical, astronomical, geographical,
and historical pursuits. The work entitled
"Catasterisms," doubtfully imputed to him, is a catalogue of
475 of the principal stars; but it was probably intended
for nothing more than a manual. He also is said to have
written a poem upon terrestrial zones. Among his important
geographical labours may be mentioned his
determination of the interval between the tropics. He
found it to be eleven eighty-thirds of the circumference.
He also attempted the measurement of the size of the
earth by ascertaining the distance between Alexandria
and Syene, the difference of latitude between which he
had found to be one-fiftieth of the earth's circumference.
It was his object to free geography from the legends with
which the superstition of ages had adorned and oppressed
it. In effecting this he well deserves the tribute paid to
him by Humboldt, the modern who of all others could
best appreciate his labours. He considered the articulation
and expansion of continents; the position of mountain
chains; the action of clouds; the geological submersion of
lands; the elevation of ancient sea-beds; the opening of the
Dardanelles and of the Straits of Gibraltar; the relations
of the Euxine Sea; the problem of the equal level of the
circumfluous ocean; and the necessary existence of a
mountain chain running through Asia in the diaphragm
of Dicæarchus. What an advance is all this beyond the
meditations of Thales! Herein we see the practical
tendencies of the Macedonian wars. In his astronomical
observations he had the advantage of using the armils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and other instruments in the Observatory. He ascertained
that the direction of terrestrial gravity is not
constant, but that the verticals converge. He composed a
complete systematic description of the earth in three
books&mdash;physical, mathematical, historical&mdash;accompanied
by a map of all the parts then known. Of his skill as a
geometer, his solution of the problem of two mean proportionals,
still extant, offers ample evidence; and it is
only of late years that the fragments remaining of his
Chronicles of the Theban Kings have been properly appreciated.
He hoped to free history as well as geography
from the myths that deform it, a task which the prejudices
and interests of man will never permit to be accomplished.
Some amusing anecdotes of his opinions in these respects
have descended to us. He ventured to doubt the historical
truth of the Homeric legends. "I will believe in it when
I have been shown the currier who made the wind-bags
which Ulysses on his homeward voyage received from
Æolus." It is said that, having attained the age of
eighty years, he became weary of life, and put an end to
himself by voluntary starvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronology of Eratosthenes.</div>

<p>I shall here pause to make a few remarks suggested by
the chronological and astronomical works of
Eratosthenes. Our current chronology was the
offspring of erroneous theological considerations, the
nature of which required not only a short historical term for
the various nations of antiquity, but even for the existence
of man upon the globe. This necessity appears to have
been chiefly experienced in the attempt to exalt certain
facts in the history of the Hebrews from their subordinate
position in human affairs, and, indeed, to give the whole
of that history an exaggerated value. This was done in a
double way: by elevating Hebrew history from its true
grade, and depreciating or falsifying that of other nations.
Among those who have been guilty of this literary offence,
the name of the celebrated Eusebius, the Bishop of
Cæsarea in the time of Constantine, should be designated,
since in his chronography and synchronal tables he
purposely "perverted chronology for the sake of making
synchronisms" (Bunsen). It is true, as Niebuhr asserts,
"He is a very dishonest writer." To a great extent, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
superseding of the Egyptian annals was brought about by
his influence. It was forgotten, however, that of all
things chronology is the least suited to be an object of
inspiration; and that, though men may be wholly
indifferent to truth for its own sake, and consider it not
improper to wrest it unscrupulously to what they may
suppose to be a just purpose, yet that it will vindicate itself
at last. It is impossible to succeed completely in perverting
the history of a nation which has left numerous enduring
records. Egypt offers us testimonials reaching over five
thousand years. As Bunsen remarks, from the known
portion of the curve of history we may determine the
whole. The Egyptians, old as they are, belong to the
middle ages of mankind, for there is a period antecedent
to monumental history, or indeed, to history of any kind,
during which language and mythology are formed, for
these must exist prior to all political institutions, all art,
all science. Even at the first moment that we gain a
glimpse of the state of Egypt she had attained a high
intellectual condition, as is proved by the fact that her
system of hieroglyphics was perfected before the fourth
dynasty. It continued unchanged until the time of
Psammetichus. A stationary condition of language and
writing for thousands of years necessarily implies a long
and very remote period of active improvement and
advance. It was doubtless such a general consideration,
rather than a positive knowledge of the fact, which led
the Greeks to assert that the introduction of geometry
into Egypt must be attributed to kings before the times
of Menes. Not alone do her artificial monuments attest
for that country an extreme antiquity; she is herself her
own witness; for, though the Nile raises its bed only four
feet in a thousand years, all the alluvial portion of Egypt
has been deposited from the waters of that river. A
natural register thus re-enforces the written records, and
both together compose a body of evidence not to be
gainsaid. Thus the depth of muddy silt accumulated
round the pedestals of monuments is an irreproachable
index of their age. In the eminent position he occupied,
Eusebius might succeed in perverting the received book-chronology;
but he had no power to make the endless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
trade-wind that sweeps over the tropical Pacific blow a
day more or a day less; none to change the weight of
water precipitated from it by the African mountains;
none to arrest the annual mass of mud brought down by
the river. It is by collating such different orders of
evidence together&mdash;the natural and the monumental, the
latter gaining strength every year from the cultivation of
hieroglyphic studies&mdash;that we begin to discern the true
Egyptian chronology, and to put confidence in the
fragments that remain of Eratosthenes and Manetho.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy of Eratosthenes.</div>

<p>At the time of which we are speaking&mdash;the time of
Eratosthenes&mdash;general ideas had been attained to respecting
the doctrine of the sphere, its poles, axis, the equator,
arctic and antarctic circles, equinoctial points,
solstices, colures, horizon, etc. No one competent
to form an opinion any longer entertained a doubt
respecting the globular form of the earth, the arguments
adduced in support of that fact being such as are still
popularly resorted to&mdash;the different positions of the
horizon at different places, the changes in elevation of the
pole, the phenomena of eclipses, and the gradual disappearance
of ships as they sail from us. As to eclipses,
once looked upon with superstitious awe, their true causes
had not only been assigned, but their periodicities so well
ascertained that predictions of their occurrence could be
made. The Babylonians had thus long known that after
a cycle of 223 lunations the eclipses of the moon return.
<span class="sidenote">Attempts of Aristarchus to find the distance of the sun.</span>
The mechanism of the phases of that satellite
was clearly understood. Indeed, Aristarchus
of Samos attempted to ascertain the distance of
the sun from the earth on the principle of
observing the moon when she is dichotomized, a method
quite significant of the knowledge of the time, though in
practice untrustworthy; Aristarchus thus finding that the
sun's distance is eighteen times that of the moon, whereas
it is in reality 400. In like manner, in a general way,
pretty clear notions were entertained of the climatic
distribution of heat upon the earth, exaggerated, however,
in this respect, that the torrid zone was believed to be
too hot for human life, and the frigid too cold. Observations,
as good as could be made by simple instruments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
had not only demonstrated in a general manner the
progressions, retrogradations and stations of the planets,
but attempts had been made to account for, or rather to
represent them, by the aid of epicycles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biography of the Ptolemies.</div>

<p>It was thus in Alexandria, under the Ptolemies, that
modern astronomy arose. Ptolemy Soter, the founder
of this line of kings, was not only a patron of science,
but likewise an author. He composed a history of the
campaigns of Alexander. Under him the collection of the
library was commenced, probably soon after the
defeat of Antigonus at the battle of Ipsus, <small>B.C.</small>
301. The museum is due to his son Ptolemy Philadelphus,
who not only patronized learning in his own dominions,
but likewise endeavoured to extend the boundaries of
human knowledge in other quarters. Thus he sent an
expedition under his admiral Timosthenes as far as
Madagascar. Of the succeeding Ptolemies, Euergetes and
Philopator were both very able men, though the later was
a bad one; he murdered his father, and perpetrated many
horrors in Alexandria. Epiphanes, succeeding his father
when only five years old, was placed by his guardians
under the protection of Rome, thus furnishing to the
ambitious republic a pretence for interfering in the affairs
of Egypt. The same policy was continued during the
reign of his son Philometor, who, upon the whole, was an
able and good king. Even Physcon, who succeeded in
<small>B.C.</small> 146, and who is described as sensual, corpulent, and
cruel&mdash;cruel, for he cut off the head, hands, and feet of his
son, and sent them to Cleopatra his wife&mdash;could not resist
the inspirations to which the policy of his ancestors,
continued for nearly two centuries, had given birth, but
was an effective promoter of literature and the arts, and
himself the author of an historical work. A like inclination
was displayed by his successors, Lathyrus and
Auletes, the name of the latter indicating his proficiency
in music. The surnames under which all these Ptolemies
pass were nicknames, or titles of derision imposed upon
them by their giddy and satirical Alexandrian subjects.
The political state of Alexandria was significantly said to
be a tyranny tempered by ridicule. The dynasty ended
in the person of the celebrated Cleopatra, who, after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
battle of Actium, caused herself, as is related in the
legends, to be bitten by an asp. She took poison that she
might not fall captive to Octavianus, and be led in his
triumph through the streets of Rome.</p>

<p>If we possessed a complete and unbiased history of
these Greek kings, it would doubtless uphold their title
to be regarded as the most illustrious of all ancient
sovereigns. Even after their political power had passed
into the hands of the Romans&mdash;a nation who had no regard
to truth and to right&mdash;and philosophy, in its old age, had
become extinguished or eclipsed by the faith of the later
Cæsars, enforced by an unscrupulous use of their power, so
strong was the vitality of the intellectual germ they had
fostered, that, though compelled to lie dormant for
centuries, it shot up vigorously on the first occasion that
favouring circumstances allowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They patronize literature
as well as science.</div>

<p>This Egyptian dynasty extended its protection and
patronage to literature as well as to science. Thus
Philadelphus did not consider it beneath him to count
among his personal friends the poet Callimachus,
who had written a treatise on birds, and honourably
maintained himself by keeping a school in
Alexandria. The court of that sovereign was,
moreover, adorned by a constellation of seven poets, to
which the gay Alexandrians gave the nickname of the
Pleiades. They are said to have been Lycophron, Theocritus,
Callimachus, Aratus, Apollonius Rhodius, Nicander,
and Homer the son of Macro. Among them may be distinguished
Lycophron, whose work, entitled Cassandra,
still remains; and Theocritus, whose exquisite bucolics
prove how sweet a poet he was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings of Apollonius.</div>

<p>To return to the scientific movement. The school of
Euclid was worthily represented in the time of Euergetes
by Apollonius Pergæus, forty years later than
Archimedes. He excelled both in the mathematical
and physical department. His chief work was a
treatise on Conic Sections. It is said that he was the first
to introduce the words ellipse and hyperbola. So late as
the eleventh century his complete works were extant in
Arabic. Modern geometers describe him as handling his
subjects with less power than his great predecessor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Archimedes, but nevertheless displaying extreme precision
and beauty in his methods. His fifth book, on Maxima
and Minima, is to be regarded as one of the highest efforts
of Greek geometry. As an example of his physical inquiries
may be mentioned his invention of a clock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings of Hipparchus.</div>

<p>Fifty years after Apollonius, <small>B.C.</small> 160-125, we meet with
the great astronomer Hipparchus. He does not appear to
have made observations himself in Alexandria, but he uses
those of Aristyllus and Timochares of that place. Indeed,
his great discovery of the precession of the equinoxes was
essentially founded on the discussion of the Alexandrian
observations on Spica Virginis made by Timochares. In
pure mathematics he gave methods for solving all triangles
plane and spherical: he also constructed a table
of chords. In astronomy, besides his capital
discovery of the precession of the equinoxes just
mentioned, he also determined the first inequality of the
moon, the equation of the centre, and all but anticipated
Ptolemy in the discovery of the evection. To him also
must be attributed the establishment of the theory of
<span class="sidenote">The theory of epicycles and eccentrics.</span>
epicycles and eccentrics, a geometrical conception for the
purpose of resolving the apparent motions of the heavenly
bodies, on the principle of circular movement. In the case
of the sun and moon, Hipparchus succeeded in
the application of that theory, and indicated
that it might be adapted to the planets. Though
never intended as a representation of the actual motions of
the heavenly bodies, it maintained its ground until the era
of Kepler and Newton, when the heliocentric doctrine, and
that of elliptic motions, were incontestably established.
Even Newton himself, in the 37th proposition of the third
book of the "Principia," availed himself of its aid. Hipparchus
also undertook to make a register of the stars by the
method of alineations&mdash;that is, by indicating those which
were in the same apparent straight line. The number of
stars catalogued by him was 1,080. If he thus depicted the
aspect of the sky for his times, he also endeavoured to do
the same for the surface of the earth by marking the position
of towns and other places by lines of latitude and longitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The writings of Ptolemy.</div>

<p>Subsequently to Hipparchus, we find the astronomers
Geminus and Cleomedes; their fame, however, is totally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
eclipsed by that of Ptolemy, <small>A.D.</small> 138, the author of the
great work "Syntaxis," or the mathematical construction
of the heavens&mdash;a work fully deserving
the epithet which has been bestowed upon it, "a noble exposition
of the mathematical theory of epicycles and
eccentrics." It was translated by the Arabians after the
Mohammedan conquest of Egypt; and, under the title of
Almagest, was received by them as the highest authority
on the mechanism and phenomena of the universe. It
maintained its ground in Europe in the same eminent
position for nearly fifteen hundred years, justifying the
<span class="sidenote">His great work: the mechanical
construction of the heavens.</span>
encomium of Synesius on the institution which gave it
birth, "the divine school of Alexandria." The Almagest
commences with the doctrine that the earth is
globular and fixed in space; it describes the
construction of a table of chords and instruments
for observing the solstices, and deduces the
obliquity of the ecliptic. It finds terrestrial latitudes by
the gnomon; describes climates; shows how ordinary may
be converted into sidereal time; gives reasons for preferring
the tropical to the sidereal year; furnishes the
solar theory on the principle of the sun's orbit being a
simple eccentric; explains the equation of time; advances
to the discussion of the motions of the moon; treats of the
first inequality, of her eclipses, and the motion of the node.
It then gives Ptolemy's own great discovery&mdash;that which
has made his name immortal&mdash;the discovery of the moon's
evection or second inequality, reducing it to the epicyclic
theory. It attempts the determination of the distances of
the sun and moon from the earth, with, however, only
partial success, since it makes the sun's distance but one-twentieth
of the real amount. It considers the precession
of the equinoxes, the discovery of Hipparchus, the full
period for which is twenty-five thousand years. It gives
a catalogue of 1,022 stars; treats of the nature of the
Milky Way; and discusses, in the most masterly manner,
the motions of the planets. This point constitutes
Ptolemy's second claim to scientific fame. His determination
of the planetary orbits was accomplished by comparing
his own observations with those of former astronomers,
especially with those of Timochares on Venus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His geography.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
To Ptolemy we are also indebted for a work on Geography
used in European schools as late as the fifteenth century.
The known world to him was from the Canary Islands
eastward to China, and from the equator northward
to Caledonia. His maps, however, are very
erroneous; for, in the attempt to make them correspond
to the spherical figure of the earth, the longitudes are
too much to the east; the Mediterranean Sea is twenty
degrees too long. Ptolemy's determinations are, therefore,
inferior in accuracy to those of his illustrious predecessor
Eratosthenes, who made the distance from the sacred
promontory in Spain to the eastern mouth of the Ganges
to be seventy thousand stadia. Ptolemy also wrote on
Optics, the Planisphere, and Astrology. It is not often
given to an author to endure for so many ages; perhaps,
indeed, few deserve it. The mechanism of the heavens,
from his point of view, has however, been greatly misunderstood.
Neither he nor Hipparchus ever intended
that theory as anything more than a geometrical fiction.
It is not to be regarded as a representation of the actual
celestial motions. And, as might be expected, for such is
the destiny of all unreal abstractions, the theory kept
advancing in complexity as facts accumulated, and was on
the point of becoming altogether unmanageable, when it
was supplanted by the theory of universal gravitation,
which has ever exhibited the inalienable attribute of a
true theory&mdash;affording an explanation of every new fact
as soon as it was discovered, without requiring to be
burdened with new provisions, and prophetically foretelling
phenomena which had not as yet been observed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The later Alexandrian geometers.</div>

<p>From the time of the Ptolemies the scientific spirit of
the Alexandrian school declined; for though such mathematicians
as Theodosius, whose work on Spherical
Geometry was greatly valued by the Arab geometers; and
Pappus, whose mathematical collections, in eight
books, still for the most part remain; and Theon,
doubly celebrated for his geometrical attainments,
and as being the father of the unfortunate Hypatia,
<small>A.D.</small> 415, lived in the next three centuries, they were not
men like their great predecessors. That mental strength
which gives birth to original discovery had passed away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
The commentator had succeeded to the philosopher. No
new development illustrated the physical sciences; they
were destined long to remain stationary. Mechanics could
boast of no trophy like the proposition of Archimedes on
the equilibrium of the lever; no new and exact ideas like
those of the same great man on statical and hydrostatical
pressure; no novel and clear views like those developed in
his treatise on floating bodies; no mechanical invention
like the first of all steam-engines&mdash;that of Hero. Natural
<span class="sidenote">Decline of the Greek age of Reason.</span>
Philosophy had come to a stop. Its great, and hitherto
successfully cultivated department, Astronomy, exhibited
no farther advance. Men were content with
what had been done, and continued to amuse
themselves with reconciling the celestial phenomena
to a combination of equable circular motions. To
what are we to attribute this pause? Something had
occurred to enervate the spirit of science. A gloom had
settled on the Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of that decline.</div>

<p>There is no difficulty in giving an explanation of this
unfortunate condition. Greek intellectual life had passed
the period of its maturity, and was entering on old age.
Moreover, the talent which might have been devoted to the
service of science was in part allured to another pursuit,
and in part repressed. Alexandria had sapped Athens, and
in her turn Alexandria was sapped by Rome.
From metropolitan pre-eminence she had sunk to
be a mere provincial town. The great prizes of life were
not so likely to be met with in such a declining city as in
Italy or, subsequently, in Constantinople. Whatever
affected these chief centres of Roman activity, necessarily
influenced her; but, such is the fate of the conquered, she
must await their decisions. In the very institutions by
which she had once been glorified, success could only be
attained by a conformity to the manner of thinking
fashionable in the imperial metropolis, and the best that
could be done was to seek distinction in the path so marked
out. Yet even with all this restraint Alexandria asserted
her intellectual power, leaving an indelible impress on the
new theology of her conquerors. During three centuries
the intellectual atmosphere of the Roman empire had been
changing. Men were unable to resist the steadily increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
pressure. Tranquillity could only be secured by passiveness.
Things had come to such a state that the thinking of men
was to be done for them by others, or, if they thought at
all, it must be in accordance with a prescribed formula or
rule. Greek intellect was passing into decrepitude, and the
moral condition of the European world was in antagonism
to scientific progress.</p>

He is full of admiration for the past and of contemptuous
disgust at the present; his thoughts are wandering to the
things that occupied him in his youth, and even in his
infancy. Like those who are ready to die, he delivers
himself up to religious preparation, without any farther
concern whether the things on which he is depending are
intrinsically true or false.</p>

<p>In this, the closing scene, no more do we find the vivid
faith of Plato, the mature intellect of Aristotle, the manly
self-control of Zeno. Greek philosophy is ending in
garrulity and mysticism. It is leaning for help on the
conjurer, juggler, and high-priest of Nature.</p>

<p>There are also new-comers obtruding themselves on the
stage. The Roman soldier is about to take the place of
the Greek thinker, and assert his claim to the effects of the
intestate&mdash;to keep what suits him, and to destroy what
he pleases. The Romans, advancing towards their age of
Faith, are about to force their ideas on the European
world.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of the Pyramids Greek philosophy
was born; after many wanderings for a thousand years
round the shores of the Mediterranean, it came back to its
native place, and under the shadow of the Pyramids it died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It becomes retrospective.</div>

<p>From the period of the New Academy the decline of
Greek philosophy was uninterrupted. Inventive genius
no longer existed; its place was occupied by the commentator.
Instead of troubling themselves with inquiries
after absolute truth, philosophers sought support
in the opinions of the ancient times,
and the real or imputed views of Pythagoras, Plato, or
Aristotle were received as a criterion. In this, the old
age of philosophy, men began to act as though there had
never been such things as original investigation and
discovery among the human race, and that whatever truth
there was in the world was not the product of thought,
but the remains of an ancient and now all but forgotten
revelation from heaven&mdash;forgotten through the guilt and
fall of man. There is something very melancholy in this
total cessation of inquiry. The mental impetus, which
one would have expected to continue for a season by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
reason of the momentum that had been gathered in so
many ages, seems to have been all at once abruptly lost.
So complete a pause is surprising: the arrow still flies on
after it has parted from the bow; the potter's wheel runs
round though all the vessels are finished. In producing
this sudden stoppage, the policy of the early Cæsars
greatly assisted. The principle of liberty of thought,
which the very existence of the divers philosophical
schools necessarily implied, was too liable to make itself
manifest in aspirations for political liberty. While through
the emperors the schools of Greece, of Alexandria, and
Rome were depressed from that supremacy to which they
might have aspired, and those of the provinces, as
Marseilles and Rhodes, were relatively exalted, the
former, in a silent and private way, were commencing
<span class="sidenote">Has arrived at Oriental ideas.</span>
those rivalries, the forerunners of the great theological
struggles between them in after ages for political power.
Christianity in its dawn was attended by a
general belief that in the East there had been
preserved a purer recollection of the ancient revelation,
and that hence from that quarter the light would
presently shine forth. Under the favouring influence of
such an expectation, Orientalism, to which, as we have
seen, Grecian thought had spontaneously arrived, was
greatly re-enforced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philo the Jew thinks he is inspired.</div>

<p>In this final period of Greek philosophy, the first to
whom we must turn is Philo the Jew, who lived in the
time of the Emperor Caligula. In harmony with the ideas
of his nation, he derives all philosophy and useful
knowledge from the Mosaic record, not
hesitating to wrest Scripture to his use by
various allegorical interpretations, asserting that man has
fallen from his primitive wisdom and purity; that
physical inquiry is of very little avail, but that an
innocent life and a burning faith are what we must trust
to. He persuaded himself that a certain inspiration fell
upon him while he was in the act of writing, somewhat
like that of the penmen of the Holy Scriptures. His
readers may, however, be disposed to believe that herein
he was self-deceived, judging both from the character of
his composition and the nature of his doctrine. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
respects the former, he writes feebly, is vacillating in his
<span class="sidenote">His mystical philosophy.</span>
views, and, when watched in his treatment of a difficult
point, is seen to be wavering and unsteady. As
respects the latter, among other extraordinary
things he teaches that the world is the chief angel or first
son of God; he combines all the powers of God into one
force, the Logos or holy Word, the highest powers being
creative wisdom and governing mercy. From this are
emitted all the mundane forces; and, since God cannot do
evil, the existence of evil in the world must be imputed
to these emanating forces. It is very clear, therefore,
that though Philo declined Oriental pantheism, he laid
his foundation on the Oriental theory of Emanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apollonius of Tyana.<br /><br />
Is a miracle-worker and prophet.</div>

<p>As aiding very greatly in the popular introduction of
Orientalism, Apollonius of Tyana must be mentioned.
Under the auspices of the Empress Julia Domna, in a
biographical composition, Philostratus had the audacity to
institute a parallel between this man and our
Saviour. He was a miracle-worker, given to
soothsaying and prophesying, led the life of an ascetic,
his raiment and food being of the poorest. He attempted
a reformation of religious rites and morals;
denied the efficacy of sacrifice, substituting for
it a simple worship and a pure prayer, scarce
even needing words. He condemned the poets for propagating
immoral fables of the gods, since they had
thereby brought impurity into religion. He maintained
the doctrine of transmigration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plutarch leans to patronizing Orientalism.</div>

<p>Plutarch, whose time reaches to the Emperor Hadrian,
has exercised an influence, through certain peculiarities of
his style, which has extended even to us. As a philosopher
he is to be classed among the Platonists, yet
with a predominance of the prevailing Orientalism.
His mental peculiarities seem to have
unfitted him for an acceptance of the national faith, and
his works commend themselves rather by the pleasant
manner in which he deals with the topic on which he
treats than by a deep philosophy. In some respects an
analogy may be discerned between his views and those of
Philo, the Isis of the one corresponding to the Word of
the other. This disposition to Orientalism occurs still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
more strongly in succeeding writers; for example, Lucius
<span class="sidenote">Numenius inclines to a
trinitarian philosophy.</span>
Apuleius the Numidian, and Numenius: the
latter embracing the opinion that had now
become almost universal&mdash;that all Greek philosophy
was originally brought from the East. In
his doctrine a trinity is assumed, the first person of which
is reason; the second the principle of becoming, which is
a dual existence, and so gives rise to a third person, these
three persons constituting, however, only one God. Having
indicated the occurrence of this idea, it is not necessary
for us to inquire more particularly into its details. As
philosophical conceptions, none of the trinities of the
Greeks will bear comparison with those of ancient Egypt,
Amun, Maut, and Khonso, Osiris, Isis, and Horus; nor
with those of India, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, the
Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, or, the Past, the
Present, and the Future of the Buddhists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ammonius Saccas founds Neo-Platonism.</div>

<p>The doctrines of Numenius led directly to those of Neo-Platonism,
of which, however, the origin is commonly
imputed to Ammonius Saccas of Alexandria,
toward the close of the second century after
Christ. The views of this philosopher do not
appear to have been committed to writing.
They are known to us through his disciples Longinus and
Plotinus chiefly. Neo-Platonism, assuming the aspect of
a philosophical religion, is distinguished for the conflict it
maintained with the rising power of Christianity. Alexandria
was the scene of this contest. The school which
there arose lasted for about 300 years. Its history is not
only interesting to us from its antagonism to that new
power which soon was to conquer the Western world,
but also because it was the expiring effort of Grecian
philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plotinus, a Mystic. Reunion with God.</div>

<p>Plotinus, an Egyptian, was born about <small>A.D.</small> 204. He
studied at Alexandria, and is said to have spent
eleven years under Ammonius Saccas. He accompanied
the expedition of the Emperor
Gordian to Persia and India, and, escaping
from its disasters, opened a philosophical school in Rome.
In that city he was held in the highest esteem by the
Emperor Gallienus; the Empress Salonina intended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
build a city, in which Plotinus might inaugurate the
celebrated Republic of Plato. The plan was not, however,
carried out. With the best intention for promoting
the happiness of man, Plotinus is to be charged with no
little obscurity and mysticism. Eunapius says truly that
the heavenly elevation of his mind and his perplexed style
make him very tiresome and unpleasant. His repulsiveness
is, perhaps, in a measure due to his want of skill in
the art of composition, for he did not learn to write till
he was fifty years old. He professed a contempt for the
advantages of life and for its pursuits. He disparaged
patriotism. An ascetic in his habits, eating no flesh and
but little bread, he held his body in utter contempt,
saying that it was only a phantom and a clog to his soul.
He refused to remember his birthday. As has frequently
been the case with those who have submitted to prolonged
fasting and meditation, he believed that he had been
privileged to see God with his bodily eye, and on six
different occasions had been reunited to him. In such
a mental condition, it may well be supposed that his
writings are mysterious, inconsequent and diffuse. An
air of Platonism mingled with many Oriental ideas and
ancient Egyptian recollections, pervades his works.</p>

<p>Like many of his predecessors, Plotinus recognized a
difference between the mental necessities of the educated
and the vulgar, justifying mythology on the ground that
it was very useful to those who were not yet emancipated
from the sensible. Aristotle, in his Metaphysics, referring
to mythology and the gods in human form, had remarked,
"Much has been mythically added for the persuasion of
the multitude, and also on account of the laws and for
other useful ends." But Plotinus also held that the gods
are not to be moved by prayer, and that both they and
the dæmons occasionally manifest themselves visibly;
that incantations may be lawfully practised, and are not
repugnant to philosophy. In the body he discerns a
penitential mechanism for the soul. He believes that the
external world is a mere phantom&mdash;a dream&mdash;and the
indications of the senses altogether deceptive. The union
with the divinity of which he speaks he describes as
an intoxication of the soul which, forgetting all external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
things, becomes lost in the contemplation of "the One."
<span class="sidenote">The trinity of Plotinus.</span>
The doctrinal philosophy of Plotinus presents a trinity in
accordance with the Platonic idea. (1.) The One, or
Prime essence. (2.) The Reason. (3.) The Soul. Of the
first he declares that it is impossible to speak
fully, and in what he says on this point there
are many apparent contradictions, as when he denies
oneness to the one. His ideas of the trinity are essentially
based on the theory of emanation. He describes how the
second principle issues by emanation out of the first, and
the third out of the second. The mechanism of this
process may be illustrated by recalling how from the body
of the sun issues forth light, and from light emerges heat.
In the procession of the third from the second principle it
is really Thought arising from Reason; but Thought is
the Soul. The mundane soul he considers as united to
nothing; but on these details he falls into much mysticism,
and it is often difficult to see clearly his precise
meaning, as when he says that Reason is surrounded by
Eternity, but the Soul is surrounded by Time. He carries
Idealism to its last extreme, and, as has been said, looks
upon the visible world as a semblance only, deducing
from his doctrine moral reflections to be a comfort in the
trials of life. Thus he says that "sensuous life is a mere
stage-play; all the misery in it is only imaginary, all
grief a mere cheat of the players." "The soul is not in
the game; it looks on, while nothing more than the
external phantom weeps and laments." "Passive affections
and misery light only on the outward shadow of
man." The great end of existence is to draw the soul
from external things and fasten it in contemplation on
God. Such considerations teach us a contempt for virtue as
well as for vice: "Once united with God, man leaves
the virtues, as on entering the sanctuary he leaves the
images of the gods in the ante-temple behind." Hence we
<span class="sidenote">Ecstasy; communion with the invisible.</span>
should struggle to free ourselves from everything low and
mean: to cultivate truth, and devote life to
intimate communion with God, divesting ourselves
of all personality, and passing into the
condition of ecstasy, in which the soul is loosened from its
material prison, separated from individual consciousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and absorbed in the infinite intelligence from which it
emanated. "In ecstasy it contemplates real existence; it
identifies itself with that which it contemplates." Our
reminiscence passes into intuition. In all these views of
Plotinus the tincture of Orientalism predominates; the
principles and practices are altogether Indian. The
Supreme Being of the system is the "unus qui est omnia;"
the intention of the theory of emanation is to find a philosophical
connexion between him and the soul of man; the
process for passing into ecstasy by sitting long in an
invariable posture, by looking steadfastly at the tip of the
nose, or by observing for a long time an unusual or definite
manner of breathing, had been familiar to the Eastern
devotees, as they are now to the impostors of our own times;
the result is not celestial, but physiological. The pious
Hindus were, however, assured that, as water will not wet
the lotus, so, though sin may touch, it can never defile the
soul after a full intuition of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Porphyry&mdash;his writings destroyed;<br /><br />
resorts to magic and necromancy.</div>

<p>The opinions of Plotinus were strengthened and diffused
by his celebrated pupil Porphyry, who was born at Tyre
<small>A.D.</small> 233. After the death of Plotinus he established a
school in Rome, attaining great celebrity in astronomy,
music, geography, and other sciences. His treatise against
Christianity was answered by Eusebius, St. Jerome, and
others; the Emperor Theodosius the Great, however,
silenced it more effectually by causing all the
copies to be burned. Porphyry asserts his own
unworthiness when compared with his master,
saying that he had been united to God but once in eighty-six
years, whereas Plotinus had been so united six times in
sixty years. In him is to be seen all the mysticism, and, it
may be added, all the piety of Plotinus. He speaks of
dæmons shapeless, and therefore invisible; requiring food,
and not immortal; some of which rule the air, and may be
propitiated or restrained by magic: he admits also the use
of necromancy. It is scarcely possible to determine
how much this inclination of the Neo-Platonists
to the unlawful art is to be regarded
as a concession to the popular sentiment of the times, for
elsewhere Porphyry does not hesitate to condemn soothsaying
and divination, and to dwell upon the folly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
invoking the gods in making bargains, marriages, and such-like
trifles. He strenuously enjoins a holy life in view of
the fact that man has fallen both from his ancient purity
and knowledge. He recommends a worship in silence and
pure thought, the public worship being of very secondary
importance. He also insists on an abstinence from animal
food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iamblicus a wonder-worker.</div>

<p>The cultivation of magic and the necromantic art was
fully carried out in Iamblicus, a C&oelig;lo-Syrian, who died in
the reign of Constantine the Great. It is
scarcely necessary to relate the miracles and
prodigies he performed, though they received
full credence in those superstitious times; how, by the
intensity of his prayers, he raised himself unsupported
nine feet above the ground; how he could make rays of a
blinding effulgence play round his head; how, before the
bodily eyes of his pupils, he evoked two visible dæmonish
imps. Nor is it necessary to mention the opinions of
Ædesius, Chrysanthus, or Maximus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclus unites emanation with mysticism.</div>

<p>For a moment, however, we may turn to Proclus, who
was born in Constantinople <small>A.D.</small> 412. When Vitalian
laid siege to Constantinople, Proclus is said to have burned
his ships with a polished brass mirror. It is scarcely
possible for us to determine how much truth
there is in this, since similar authority affirms
that he could produce rain and earthquakes.
His theurgic propensities are therefore quite
distinct. Yet, notwithstanding these superhuman powers,
together with special favours displayed to him by Apollo,
Athene, and other divinities, he found it expedient to cultivate
his rites in secret, in terror of persecution by the
Christians, whose attention he had drawn upon himself by
writing a work in opposition to them. Eventually they
succeeded in expelling him from Athens, thereby teaching
him a new interpretation of the moral maxim he had
adopted, "Live concealed." It was the aim of Proclus to
construct a complete theology, which should include the
theory of emanation, and be duly embellished with mysticism.
The Orphic poems and Chaldæan oracles were the
basis upon which he commenced; his character may be
understood from the dignity he assumed as "high priest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the universe." He recommended to his disciples the study
of Aristotle for the sake of cultivating the reason, but
enjoined that of Plato, whose works he found to be full of
sublime allegories suited to his purpose. He asserted that
to know one's own mind is to know the whole universe, and
that that knowledge is imparted to us by revelations and
illuminations of the gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Justinian puts an end to philosophy.</div>

<p>He speculates on the manner in which absorption is to
take place; whether the last form can pass at once into
the primitive, or whether it is needful for it to resume, in
a returning succession, the intervening states of its career.
From such elevated ideas, considering the mystical manner
in which they were treated, there was no other prospect
for philosophy than to end as Neo-Platonism did under
Damasius. The final days were approaching.
The Emperor Justinian prohibited the teaching
of philosophy, and closed its schools in Athens
<small>A.D.</small> 529. Its last representatives, Damasius, Simplicius, and
Isidorus, went as exiles to Persia, expecting to find a retreat
under the protection of the great king, who boasted that he
was a philosopher and a Platonist. Disappointed, they were
fain to return to their native land; and it must be recorded
to the honour of Chosroes that, in his treaty of peace
with the Romans, he stipulated safety and toleration for
these exiles, vainly hoping that they might cultivate their
philosophy and practise their rites without molestation.</p>

<p>So ends Greek philosophy. She is abandoned, and preparation
made for crowning Faith in her stead. The inquiries
of the Ionians, the reasoning of the Eleatics, the labours
of Plato, of Aristotle, have sunk into mysticism and the
art of the conjurer. As with the individual man, so with
philosophy in its old age: when all else had failed it threw
itself upon devotion, seeking consolation in the exercises
of piety&mdash;a frame of mind in which it was ready to die.
The whole period from the New Academy shows that the
grand attempt, every year becoming more and more urgent,
was to find a system which should be in harmony with
that feeling of religious devotion into which the Roman
empire had fallen&mdash;a feeling continually gathering force.
An air of piety, though of a most delusive kind, had
settled upon the whole pagan world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of Greek philosophy.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
From the long history of Greek philosophy presented in
the foregoing pages, we turn, 1st, to an investigation
of the manner of progress of the Greek
mind; and, 2nd, to the results to which it
attained.</p>

<p>The period occupied by the events we have been
considering extends over almost twelve centuries. It
commences with Thales, <small>B.C.</small> 636, and ends <small>A.D.</small> 529.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Age of Inquiry&mdash;its solutions.</div>

<p>1st. Greek philosophy commenced on the foundation of
physical suggestions. Its first object was the
determination of the origin and manner of production
of the world. The basis upon which it
rested was in its nature unsubstantial, for it included intrinsic
errors due to imperfect and erroneous observations.
It diminished the world and magnified man, accepting the
apparent aspect of Nature as real, and regarding the earth
as a flat surface, on which the sky was sustained like a
dome. It limited the boundaries of the terrestrial plane to
an insignificant extent, and asserted that it was the special
<span class="sidenote">First problem. Origin of the world.</span>
and exclusive property of man. The stars and
other heavenly bodies it looked upon as mere
meteors or manifestations of fire. With superficial
simplicity, it received the notions of absolute directions
in space, up and down, above and below. In a like
spirit is adopted, from the most general observation, the
doctrine of four elements, those forms of substance naturally
presented to us in a predominating quantity&mdash;earth, water,
air, fire. From these slender beginnings it made its first
attempt at a cosmogony, or theory of the mode of creation,
by giving to one of these elements a predominance or superiority
over the other three, and making them issue from
it. With one teacher the primordial element was water;
with another, air; with another, fire. Whether a genesis
had thus taken place, or whether all four elements were co-ordinate
and equal, the production of the world was of easy
explanation; for, by calling in the aid of ordinary observation,
which assures us that mud will sink to the bottom of
water, that water will fall through air, that it is the
apparent nature of fire to ascend, and, combining these
illusory facts with the erroneous notion of up and down in
space, the arrangement of the visible world became clear&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
earth down below, the water floating upon it, the air above,
and, still higher, the region of fire. Thus it appears
that the first inquiry made by European philosophy was,
Whence and in what manner came the world?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its irreligious solution thereof.</div>

<p>The principles involved in the solution of this problem
evidently led to a very important inference, at this early
period betraying what was before long to become a serious
point of dispute. It is natural for man to see in things
around him visible tokens of divinity, continual providential
dispensations. But in this, its very first act,
Greek philosophy had evidently excluded God from his
own world. This settling of the heavy, this ascending of
the light, was altogether a purely physical
affair; the limitless sea, the blue air, and the unnumbered
shining stars, were set in their appropriate
places, not at the pleasure or by the hand of God,
but by innate properties of their own. Popular superstition
was in some degree appeased by the localization of
deities in the likeness of men in a starry Olympus above
the sky, a region furnishing unsubstantial glories and a
tranquil abode. And yet it is not possible to exclude
altogether the spiritual from this world. The soul, ever
active and ever thinking, asserts its kindred with the
divine. What is that soul? Such was the second question
propounded by Greek philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second problem. What is the soul?<br /><br />
Its material solution thereof.</div>

<p>A like course of superficial observation was resorted to
in the solution of this inquiry. To breathe is to
live; then the breath is the life. If we cease to
breathe we die. Man only becomes a living soul
when the breath of life enters his nostrils; he is a senseless
and impassive form when the last breath is expired. In
this life-giving principle, the air, must therefore exist all
those noble qualities possessed by the soul. It must be the
source from which all intellect arises, the store to which all
intellect again returns. The philosophical school whose
fundamental principle was that the air is the primordial
element thus brought back the Deity into the
world, though under a material form. Yet still
it was in antagonism to the national polytheism,
unless from that one god, the air, the many gods of
Olympus arose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third problem. What is God?</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
But who is that one God? This is the third question
put forth by Greek philosophy. Its answer
betrays that in this, its beginning, it is tending
to Pantheism.</p>

<p>In all these investigations the starting-point had been
material conceptions, depending on the impressions or
information of the senses. Whatever the conclusion arrived
at, its correctness turned on the correctness of that information.
When we put a little wine into a measure of
water, the eye may no longer see it, but the wine is there.
When a rain-drop falls on the leaves of a distant forest,
we cannot hear it, but the murmur of many drops composing
a shower is audible enough. But what is that
murmur except the sum of the sounds of all the individual
drops?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fourth problem. Has man a criterion of truth?</div>

<p>And so it is plain our senses are prone to
deceive us. Hence arises the fourth great
question of Greek philosophy: Have we any
criterion of truth?</p>

<p>The moment a suspicion that we have not crosses the
mind of man, he realizes what may be truly termed intellectual
despair. Is this world an illusion, a phantasm of
the imagination? If things material and tangible, and
therefore the most solid props of knowledge, are thus
abruptly destroyed, in what direction shall we turn?
Within a single century Greek philosophy had come to this
<span class="sidenote">Importance of the views of Pythagoras.</span>
pass, and it was not without reason that intelligent men
looked on Pythagoras almost as a divinity upon
earth when he pointed out to them a path of
escape; when he bid them reflect on what it was
that had thus taught them the fallibility of sense. For
what is it but reason that has been thus warning us, and,
in the midst of delusions, has guided us to the truth&mdash;reason,
which has objects of her own, a world of her own?
Though the visible and audible may deceive, we may
nevertheless find absolute truth in things altogether
separate from material nature, particularly in the relations
of numbers and properties of geometrical forms. There is
no illusion in this, that two added to two make four; or in
this, that any two sides of a triangle taken together are
greater than the third. If, then, we are living in a region
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of deceptions, we may rest assured that it is surrounded by
a world of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the Eleatic school and the Sophists.</div>

<p>From the material basis speculative philosophy gradually
disengaged itself through the labours of
the Eleatic school, the controversy as to the
primary element receding into insignificance,
and being replaced by investigations as to Time,
Motion, Space, Thought, Being, God. The general result of
these inquiries brought into prominence the suspicion of the
untrustworthiness of the senses, the tendency of the whole
period being manifested in the hypothesis at last attained,
that atoms and space alone exist; and, since the former are
mere centres of force, matter is necessarily a phantasm.
When, therefore, the Athenians themselves commenced the
cultivation of philosophy, it was with full participation in
the doubt and uncertainty thus overspreading the whole
subject. As Sophists, their action closed this speculative
period, for, by a comparison of all the partial sciences thus
far known, they arrived at the conclusion that there is no
conscience, no good or evil, no philosophy, no religion, no
law, no criterion of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Age of faith&mdash;its solutions.</div>

<p>But man cannot live without some guiding rule. If his
speculations in Nature will yield him nothing on which he
may rely, he will seek some other aid. If there be no
criterion of truth for him in philosophy, he will lean on
implicit, unquestioning faith. If he cannot prove by
physical arguments the existence of God, he will,
with Socrates, accept that great fact as self
evident and needing no demonstration. He will, in like
manner, take his stand upon the undeniable advantages
of virtue and good morals, defending the doctrine that
pleasure should be the object of life&mdash;pleasure of that pure
kind which flows from a cultivation of ennobling pursuits,
or instinctive, as exhibited in the life of brutes. But when
he has thus cast aside demonstration as needless for his
purposes, and put his reliance in this manner on faith, he
has lost the restraining, the guiding principle that can set
bounds to his conduct. If he considers, with Socrates, who
opens the third age of Greek development&mdash;its age of faith&mdash;the
existence of God as not needing any proof, he may,
in like manner, add thereto the existence of matter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ideas. To faith there will be no difficulty in such doctrines
as those of Reminiscence, the double immortality
<span class="sidenote">Its continuation by Plato,
and its end by the Sceptics.</span>
of the soul, the actual existence of universals;
and, if such faith, unrestrained and unrestricted,
be directed to the regulation of personal life,
there is nothing to prevent a falling into excess and base
egoism. For ethics, in such an application, ends either in
the attempt at the procurement of extreme personal sanctity
or the obtaining of individual pleasure&mdash;the foundation
of patriotism is sapped, the sentiment of friendship is
destroyed. So it was with the period of Grecian faith
inaugurated by Socrates, developed by Plato, and closed
by the Sceptics. Antisthenes and Diogenes of Sinope, in
their outrages on society and their self-mortifications,
show to what end a period of faith, unrestrained by reason,
will come; and Epicurus demonstrated its tendency when
guided by self.</p>

<p>Thus closes the third period of Greek philosophical development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Age of Reason&mdash;its solutions.</div>

<p>In introducing us to a fourth, Aristotle insists that,
though we must rely on reason, Reason itself must submit
to be guided by Experience; and Zeno, taking
up the same thought, teaches us that we must
appeal to the decisions of common sense. He disposes of
all doubt respecting the criterion of truth by proclaiming
that the distinctness of our sensuous impressions is a sufficient
guide. In all this, the essential condition involved
is altogether different from that of the speculative ages,
and also of the age of faith. Yet, though under the
ostensible guidance of reason, the human mind ever seeks
to burst through such self-imposed restraints, attempting
to ascertain things for which it possesses no suitable data.
Even in the age of Aristotle, the age of Reason in Greece,
philosophy resumed such questions as those of the creation
of the world, the emanation of matter from God, the
existence and nature of evil, the immortality, or, alas! it
might perhaps be more truly said, judging from its conclusions,
the death of the soul, and this even after the Sceptics
had, with increased force, denied that we have any
criterion of truth, and showed to their own satisfaction
that man, at the best, can do nothing but doubt; and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
view of his condition here upon earth, since it has not been
permitted him to know what is right and what is wrong,
what is true and what is false, his wisest course is to give
himself no concern about the matter, but tranquilly sink
into a state of complete indifference and quietism.</p>

<p>How uniformly do we see that through such variations
of opinion individual man approaches his end. For Greek
philosophy, what other prospect was there but decrepitude,
with its contempt for the present, its attachment to the
past, its distrust of man, its reliance on the mysterious&mdash;the
unknown? And this imbecility how plainly we witness
before the scene finally is closed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duration of these ages.</div>

<p>If now we look back upon this career of the Grecian mind,
we find that after the legendary prehistoric period&mdash;the
age of credulity&mdash;there came in succession an age of speculative
inquiry, an age of faith, an age of reason, an age of
decrepitude&mdash;the first, the age of credulity, was closed by
geographical discovery; the second by the criticism of the
Sophists; the third by the doubts of the Sceptics; the
fourth, eminently distinguished by the greatness
of its results, gradually declined into the fifth,
an age of decrepitude, to which the hand of the Roman
put an end. In the mental progress of this people we
therefore discern the foreshadowing of a course like that of
individual life, its epochs answering to Infancy, Childhood
Youth, Manhood, Old Age; and which, on a still grander
scale, as we shall hereafter find, has been repeated by all
Europe in its intellectual development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boundaries of these ages.</div>

<p>In a space of 1150 years, ending about <small>A.D.</small> 529, the
Greek mind had completed its philosophical
career. The ages into which we have divided
that course pass by insensible gradations into each other.
They overlap and intermingle, like a gradation of colours,
but the characteristics of each are perfectly distinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of the law of variations of opinions.<br /><br />
Philosophical conclusions finally arrived at by the Greeks.</div>

<p>2nd. Having thus determined the general law of the
variation of opinions, that it is the same in this
nation as in an individual, I shall next endeavour
to disentangle the final results attained,
considering Greek philosophy as a whole. To
return to the illustration, to us more than an empty
metaphor, though in individual life there is a successive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
passage through infancy, childhood, youth, and manhood
to old age, a passage in which the characteristics of each
period in their turn disappear, yet, nevertheless, there are
certain results in another sense permanent, giving to the
whole progress its proper individuality. A
critical eye may discern in the successive stages
of Greek philosophical development decisive
and enduring results. These it is for which we
have been searching in this long and tedious discussion.</p>

<p>There are four grand topics in Greek philosophy: 1st,
the existence and attributes of God; 2nd, the origin and
destiny of the world; 3rd, the nature of the human soul;
4th, the possibility of a criterion of truth. I shall now
present what appear to me to be the results at which the
Greek mind arrived on each of these points.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As to God&mdash;His unity.</div>

<p>(1.) Of the existence and attributes of God. On this
point the decision of the Greek mind was the
absolute rejection of all anthropomorphic conceptions,
even at the risk of encountering the pressure of
the national superstition. Of the all-powerful, all-perfect,
and eternal there can be but one, for such attributes are
absolutely opposed to anything like a participation,
whether of a spiritual or material nature; and hence the
conclusion that the universe itself is God, and that all
animate and inanimate things belong to his essence. In
him they live, and move, and have their being. It is conceivable
that God may exist without the world, but it is
inconceivable that the world should exist without God.
We must not, however, permit ourselves to be deluded by
the varied aspect of things; for, though the universe is
thus God, we know it not as it really is, but only as it
appears. God has no relations to space and time. They
are only the fictions of our finite imagination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But their solution is Pantheism.</div>

<p>But this ultimate effort of the Greek mind is Pantheism.
It is the same result which the more aged
branch of the Indo-European family had long
before reached. "There is no God independent
of Nature; no other has been revealed by tradition, perceived
by the sense, or demonstrated by argument."</p>

<p>Yet never will man be satisfied with such a conclusion.
It offers him none of that aspect of personality which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
his yearnings demand. This infinite, and eternal, and
universal is no intellect at all. It is passionless, without
motive, without design. It does not answer to those lineaments
of which he catches a glimpse when he considers the
attributes of his own soul. He shudderingly turns from
Pantheism, this final result of human philosophy, and,
voluntarily retracing his steps, subordinates his reason to
his instinctive feelings; declines the impersonal as having
nothing in unison with him, and asserts a personal God,
the Maker of the universe and the Father of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As to the world&mdash;a manifestation of God.</div>

<p>(2.) Of the origin and destiny of the world. In an
examination of the results at which the Greek
mind arrived on this topic, our labour is rendered
much lighter by the assistance we receive
from the decision of the preceding inquiry.
The origin of all things is in God, of whom the world is
only a visible manifestation. It is evolved by and from
him, perhaps, as the Stoics delighted to say, as the plant
is evolved by and from the vital germ in the seed. It is
an emanation of him. On this point we may therefore
accept as correct the general impression entertained by
philosophers, Greek, Alexandrian, and Roman after the
Christian era, that, at the bottom, the Greek and Oriental
philosophies were alike, not only as respects the questions
they proposed for solution, but also in the decisions they
arrived at. As we have said, this impression led to the
belief that there must have been in the remote past a
revelation common to both, though subsequently obscured
and vitiated by the infirmities and wickedness of man.
This doctrine of emanation, reposing on the assertion that
the world existed eternally in God, that it came forth into
visibility from him, and will be hereafter absorbed into him,
is one of the most striking features of Veda theology. It is
developed with singular ability by the Indian philosophers
as well as by the Greeks, and is illustrated by their poets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This solution identical with the Oriental.</div>

<p>The following extract from the Institutes of Menu
will convey the Oriental conclusion: "This
universe existed only in the first divine idea,
yet unexpanded, as if involved in darkness;
imperceptible, undefinable, undiscoverable by reason, and
undiscovered by revelation, as if it were wholly immersed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in sleep. Then the sole self-existing power, himself undiscerned,
but making this world discernible, with five
elements and other principles of nature, appeared with
undiminished glory, expanding his idea, or dispelling the
gloom. He whom the mind alone can perceive, whose
essence eludes the external organs, who has no visible
parts, who exists from eternity&mdash;even He, the soul of all
beings, whom no being can comprehend, shone forth in
person. He, having willed to produce various beings
from his own divine substance, first with a thought created
the waters. The waters are so called (nárá) because they
were the production of <i>Nara</i>, or the spirit of God; and,
since they were his first <i>ayaná</i> or place of motion, he
thence is named Narayana, or moving on the waters.
From that which is the first cause, not the object of sense
existing everywhere in substance, not existing to our
perception, without beginning or end, was produced the
divine male. He framed the heaven above, the earth
beneath, and in the midst placed the subtle ether, the
light regions, and the permanent receptacle of waters.
He framed all creatures. He gave being to time and the
divisions of time&mdash;to the stars also and the planets. For
the sake of distinguishing actions, he made a total
difference between right and wrong. He whose powers
are incomprehensible, having created this universe, was
again absorbed in the spirit, changing the time of energy
for the time of repose."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrations of the origins, duration, and
absorption of the world.</div>

<p>From such extracts from the sacred writings of the
Hindus we might turn to their poets, and find the same
conceptions of the emanation, manifestation, and
absorption of the world illustrated. "The Infinite
being is like the clear crystal, which
receives into itself all the colours and emits
them again, yet its transparency or purity is not thereby
injured or impaired." "He is like the diamond, which
absorbs the light surrounding it, and glows in the dark
from the emanation thereof." In similes of a less noble
nature they sought to convey their idea to the illiterate
"Thou hast seen the spider spin his web, thou hast seen
its excellent geometrical form, and how well adapted it is
to its use; thou hast seen the play of tinted colours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
making it shine like a rainbow in the rays of the morning
sun. From his bosom the little artificer drew forth the
wonderful thread, and into his bosom, when it pleases
him, he can withdraw it again. So Brahm made, and so
will he absorb the world." In common the Greek and
Indian asserted that being exists for the sake of thought,
and hence they must be one; that the universe is a
thought in the mind of God, and is unaffected by the
vicissitudes of the worlds of which it is composed. In
India this doctrine of emanation had reached such apparent
precision that some asserted it was possible to
demonstrate that the entire Brahm was not transmuted
into mundane phenomena, but only a fourth part; that
there occur successive emanations and absorptions, a
periodicity in this respect being observed; that, in these
considerations, we ought to guard ourselves from any
deception arising from the visible appearance of material
things, for there is reason to believe that matter is nothing
more than forces filling space. Democritus raised us to
the noble thought that, small as it is, a single atom may
constitute a world.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Emanation has thus a double interpretation.
It sets forth the universe either as a part of
the substance of God, or as an unsubstantial something
proceeding from him: the former a conception more tangible
and readily grasped by the mind; the latter of unapproachable
sublimity, when we recall the countless
beautiful and majestic forms which Nature on all sides
presents. This visible world is only the shadow of God.</p>

<p>In the further consideration of this doctrine of the
issue forthcoming, or emanation of the universe from
God, and its return into or absorption by him, an illustration
may not be without value. Out of the air, which
may be pure and tranquil, the watery vapour often comes
forth in a visible form, a misty fleece, perhaps no larger
than the hand of a man at first, but a great cloud in the
end. The external appearance the forthcoming form
presents is determined by the incidents of the times; it
may have a pure whiteness or a threatening blackness;
its edges may be fringed with gold. In the bosom of such
a cloud the lightning may be pent up, from it the thunder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
may be heard; but, even if it should not offer these manifestations
of power, if its disappearance should be as
tranquil as its formation, it has not existed in vain. No
cloud ever yet formed on the sky without leaving an
imperishable impression on the earth, for while it yet
existed there was not a plant whose growth was not
delayed, whose substance was not lessened. And of such
a cloud the production of which we have watched, how
often has it happened to us to witness its melting away
into the untroubled air. From the untroubled air it came,
and to the pure untroubled air it has again returned.</p>

<p>Now such a cloud is made up of countless hosts of
microscopic drops, each maintaining itself separate from
the others, and each, small though it may be, having an
individuality of its own. The grand aggregate may vary
its colour and shape; it may be the scene of unceasing and
rapid interior movements of many kinds, yet it presents
its aspect unchanged, or changes tranquilly and silently,
still glowing in the light that falls on it, still casting its
shadow on the ground. It is an emblem of the universe
according to the ancient doctrine, showing us how the
visible may issue from the invisible, and return again
thereto; that a drop too small for the unassisted eye to see
may be the representative of a world. The spontaneous
emergence and disappearance of a cloud is the emblem of
a transitory universe issuing forth and disappearing, again
to be succeeded by other universes, other like creations
in the long lapse of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As to the soul&mdash;a part of the divinity.</div>

<p>(3.) Of the nature of the soul. From the material
quality assigned to the soul by the early Ionian schools, as
that it was air, fire, or the like, there was a
gradual passage to the opinion of its immateriality.
To this, precision was given by the
assertion that it had not only an affinity with, but even is
a part of God. Whatever were the views entertained of
the nature and attributes of the Supreme Being, they
directly influenced the conclusions arrived at respecting
the nature of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its immortality and final absorption.</div>

<p>Greek philosophy, in its highest state of development,
regarded the soul as something more than the sum of the
moments of thinking. It held it to be a portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Deity himself. This doctrine is the necessary corollary of
Pantheism. It contemplated a past eternity, a future
immortality. It entered on such inquiries as whether the
number of souls in the universe is constant. As upon
the foregoing point, so upon this: there was a complete
analogy between the decision arrived at in Grecian and
that in Indian philosophy. Thus the latter says, "I am
myself an irradiated manifestation of the supreme <span class="smcap">Brahm</span>."
"Never was there a time in which I was not, nor thou,
nor these princes of the people, and never shall I not be;
henceforth we all are." Viewing the soul as merely a
spectator and stranger in this world, they regarded it as
occupying itself rather in contemplation than in action,
asserting that in its origin it is an immediate emanation
from the Divinity&mdash;not a modification nor a transformation
of the Supreme, but a portion of him; "its relation is
not that of a servant to his master, but of a part to the
whole." It is like a spark separated from a flame; it
migrates from body to body, sometimes found in the
higher, then in the lower, and again in the higher tribes
of life, occupying first one, then another body, as circumstances
demand. And, as a drop of water
pursues a devious career in the cloud, in the
rain, in the river, a part of a plant, or a part of
an animal, but sooner or later inevitably finds its way
back to the sea from which it came, so the soul, however
various its fortunes may have been, sinks back at last into
the divinity from which it emanated.</p>

<p>Both Greeks and Hindus turned their attention to the
delusive phenomena of the world. Among the latter many
figuratively supposed that what we call visible nature is a
mere illusion befalling the soul, because of its temporary
separation from God. In the Buddhist philosophy the
world is thus held to be a creature of the imagination.
But among some in those ancient, as among others in more
modern times, it was looked upon as having a more substantial
condition, and the soul as a passive mirror in
which things reflected themselves, or perhaps it might, to
some extent, be the partial creator of its own forms. However
that may be, its final destiny is a perfect repose after
its absorption in the Supreme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration of the nature of the soul.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
On this third topic of ancient philosophy an illustration
may not be without use. As a bubble floats
upon the sea, and, by reason of its form, reflects
whatever objects may be present, whether the
clouds in the sky, or the stationary and moving things on
the shore, nay, even to a certain extent depicts the sea
itself on which it floats, and from which it arose, offering
these various forms not only in shapes resembling the
truth in the proper order of light and shade, the proper
perspective, the proper colours, but, in addition thereto,
tincturing them all with a play of hues arising from itself,
so it is with the soul. From a boundless and unfathomable
sea the bubble arose. It does not in any respect differ
in nature from its source. From water it came, and mere
water it ever is. It gathers its qualities, so far as external
things are concerned, only from its form, and from the
environment in which it is placed. As the circumstances
to which it is exposed vary, it floats here and there,
merging into other bubbles it meets, and emerging from
the collected foam again. In such migrations it is now
larger, now smaller; at one moment passing into new
shapes, at another lost in a coalescence with those around
it. But whatever these its migrations, these its vicissitudes,
there awaits it an inevitable destiny, an absorption, a re-incorporation
with the ocean. In that final moment, what
is it that is lost? what is it that has come to an end?
Not the essential substance, for water it was before it was
developed, water it was during its existence, and water it
still remains, ready to be re-expanded.</p>

<p>Nor does the resemblance fail when we consider the
general functions discharged while the bubble maintained
its form. In it were depicted in their true shapes and
relative magnitudes surrounding things. It hence had a
relation to Space. And, if it was in motion, it reflected in
succession the diverse objects as they passed by. Through
such successive representations it maintained a relation to
Time. Moreover, it imparted to the images it thus produced
a coloration of its own, and in all this was an
emblem of the Soul. For Space and Time are the outward
conditions with which it is concerned, and it adds thereto
abstract ideas, the product of its own nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its continued existence&mdash;its Nirwana.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
But when the bubble bursts there is an end of all these
relations. No longer is there any reflection of external
forms, no longer any motion, no longer any innate
qualities to add. In one respect the bubble is annihilated,
in another it still exists. It has returned to
that infinite expanse in comparison with which
it is altogether insignificant and imperceptible.
Transitory, and yet eternal: transitory, since all its relations
of a special and individual kind have come to an
end; eternal in a double sense&mdash;the sense of Platonism&mdash;since
it was connected with a past of which there was no
beginning, and continues in a future to which there is no
end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As to the criterion of truth&mdash;sense-delusions.</div>

<p>(4.) Of the possibility of a criterion of truth. An
absolute criterion of truth must at once accredit
itself, as well as other things. At a very early
period in philosophy the senses were detected as
being altogether untrustworthy. On numberless
occasions, instead of accrediting, they discredit themselves.
A stick, having a spark of fire at one end, gives rise to the
appearance of a circle of light when it is turned round
quickly. The rainbow seems to be an actually existing
arch until the delusion is detected by our going to the
place over which it seems to rest. Nor is it alone as
respects things for which there is an exterior basis or
foundation, such as the spark of fire in one of these cases,
and the drops of water in the other. Each of our organs
of sense can palm off delusions of the most purely fictitious
kind. The eye may present apparitions as distinct as the
realities among which they place themselves; the ear may
annoy us with the continual repetition of a murmuring
sound, or parts of a musical strain, or articulate voices,
though we well know that it is all a delusion; and in like
manner, in their proper way, in times of health, and
especially in those of sickness, will the other senses of
taste, and touch, and smell practise upon us their
deceptions.</p>

<p>This being the case, how shall we know that any information
derived from such unfaithful sources is true?
Pythagoras rendered a great service in telling us to
remember that we have within ourselves a means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
detecting fallacy and demonstrating truth. What is it that
assures us of the unreality of the fiery circle, the rainbow,
the spectre, the voices, the crawling of insects upon the
skin? Is it not reason? To reason may we not then trust?</p>

<p>With such facts before us, what a crowd of inquiries at
once presses upon our attention&mdash;inquiries which even in
modern times have occupied the thoughts of the greatest
metaphysicians. Shall we begin our studies by
<span class="sidenote">Uncertainties in philosophizing.</span>
examining sensations or by examining ideas?
Shall we say with Descartes that all clear ideas
are true? Shall we inquire with Spinoza whether we
have any ideas independent of experience? With Hobbes,
shall we say that all our thoughts are begotten by and are
the representatives of objects exterior to us; that our conceptions
arise in material motions pressing on our organs,
producing motion in them, and so affecting the mind; that
our sensations do not correspond with outward qualities;
that sound and noise belong to the bell and the air, and not
to the mind, and, like colour, are only agitations occasioned
by the object in the brain; that imagination is a conception
gradually dying away after the act of sense, and is
nothing more than a decaying sensation; that memory is
the vestige of former impressions, enduring for a time;
that forgetfulness is the obliteration of such vestiges;
that the succession of thought is not indifferent, at random,
or voluntary, but that thought follows thought in a determinate
and predestined sequence; that whatever we
imagine is finite, and hence we cannot conceive of the
infinite, nor think of anything not subject to sense?
Shall we say with Locke that there are two sources of our
ideas, sensation and reflection; that the mind cannot know
things directly, but only through ideas? Shall we suggest
with Leibnitz that reflection is nothing more than attention
to what is passing in the mind, and that between the
mind and the body there is a sympathetic synchronism?
With Berkeley shall we assert that there is no other
reason for inferring the existence of matter itself than the
necessity of having some synthesis for its attributes; that
the objects of knowledge are ideas and nothing else; and
that the mind is active in sensation? Shall we listen to
the demonstration of Hume, that, if matter be an unreal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
fiction, the mind is not less so, since it is no more than a
succession of impressions and ideas; that our belief in
causation is only the consequence of habit; and that we
have better proof that night is the cause of day, than of
thousands of other cases in which we persuade ourselves
that we know the right relation of cause and effect; that
from habit alone we believe the future will resemble the
past? Shall we infer with Condillac that memory is only
transformed sensation, and comparison double attention;
that every idea for which we cannot find an exterior object
is destitute of significance; that our innate ideas come by
development, and that reasoning and running are learned
together. With Kant shall we conclude that there is but
one source of knowledge, the union of the object and the
subject&mdash;but two elements thereof, space and time; and
that they are forms of sensibility, space being a form of
internal sensibility, and time both of internal and external,
but neither of them having any objective reality;
and that the world is not known to us as it is, but only
as it appears?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remarks on the criterion.</div>

<p>I admit the truth of the remark of Posidonius that a
man might as well be content to die as to cease philosophizing;
for, if there are contradictions in philosophy,
there are quite as many in life. In the light of this
remark, I shall therefore not hesitate to offer a few suggestions
respecting the criterion of human knowledge,
undiscouraged by the fact that so many of
the ablest men have turned their attention to it. In this
there might seem to be presumption, were it not that the
advance of the sciences, and especially of human physiology
has brought us to a more elevated point of view, and
enabled us to see the state of things much more distinctly
than was possible for our predecessors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defective information of the old philosophy.</div>

<p>I think that the inability of ancient philosophers to
furnish a true solution of this problem was
altogether owing to the imperfect, and, indeed,
erroneous idea they had of the position of man.
They gave too much weight to his personal individuality.
In the mature period of his life they regarded
him as isolated, independent, and complete in himself.
They forgot that this is only a momentary phase in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
existence, which, commencing from small beginnings, exhibits
a continuous expansion or progress. From a single
cell, scarcely more than a step above the inorganic state,
not differing, as we may infer both from the appearance it
offers and the forms through which it runs in the earlier
stages of life, from the cell out of which any other animal
or plant, even the humblest, is derived, a passage is made
<span class="sidenote">Necessity of a more general conception as to man.</span>
through form after form in a manner absolutely depending
upon surrounding physical conditions. The history is
very long, and the forms are very numerous,
between the first appearance of the primitive
trace and the hoary aspect of seventy years. It
is not correct to take one moment in this long
procession and make it a representative of the whole. It
is not correct to say, even if the body of the mature man
undergoes unceasing changes to an extent implying the
reception, incorporation, and dismissal of nearly a ton and
a half of material in the course of a year, that in this flux
of matter there is not only a permanence of form, but,
what is of infinitely more importance, an unchangeableness
in his intellectual powers. It is not correct to say
this; indeed, it is wholly untrue. The intellectual principle
passes forward in a career as clearly marked as that
in which the body runs. Even if we overlook the time
antecedent to birth, how complete is the imbecility of his
<span class="sidenote">The whole cycle must be included,</span>
early days! The light shines upon his eyes, he sees not;
sounds fall upon his ear, he hears not. From these low
beginnings we might describe the successive re-enforcements
through infancy, childhood, and
youth to maturity. And what is the result to
which all this carries us? Is it not that, in the philosophical
contemplation of man, we are constrained to
reject the idea of personality, of individuality, and to adopt
that of a cycle of progress; to abandon all contemplation
of his mere substantial form, and consider his abstract
relation? All organic forms, if compared together and
examined from one common point of view, are found to be
constructed upon an identical scheme. It is as in some
mathematical expression containing constants and variables;
the actual result changes accordingly as we assign
successively different values to the variables, yet in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
different results, no matter how numerous they may be,
the original formula always exists. From such a universal
conception of the condition and career of man, we rise at
once to the apprehension of his relations to others like
himself&mdash;that is to say, his relations as a member of
society. We perceive, in this light, that society must run
a course the counterpart of that we have traced for the
<span class="sidenote">and also his race connexions.</span>
individual, and that the appearance of isolation presented
by the individual is altogether illusory. Each individual
man drew his life from another, and to another
man he gives rise, losing, in point of fact, his
aspect of individuality when these his race connexions
are considered. One epoch in life is not all life.
The mature individual cannot be disentangled from the
multitudinous forms through which he has passed; and,
considering the nature of his primitive conception and the
issue of his reproduction, man cannot be separated from
his race.</p>

<p>By the aid of these views of the nature and relationship
of man, we can come to a decision respecting his possession
of a criterion of truth. In the earliest moments of his
existence he can neither feel nor think, and the universe
is to him as though it did not exist. Considering the
progress of his sensational powers&mdash;his sight, hearing,
touch, etc.&mdash;these, as his cycle advances to its maximum,
become, by nature or by education, more and more perfect;
but never, at the best, as the ancient philosophers well
knew, are they trustworthy. And so of his intellectual
powers. They, too, begin in feebleness and gradually
expand. The mind alone is no more to be relied on than the
organs of sense alone. If any doubt existed on this point,
the study of the phenomena of dreaming is sufficient to
remove it, for dreaming manifests to us how wavering and
unsteady is the mind in its operations when it is detached
from the solid support of the organs of sense. How true
is the remark of Philo the Jew, that the mind is like the
eye; for, though it may see all other objects, it cannot
see itself, and therefore cannot judge of itself. And thus
we may conclude that neither are the senses to be trusted
alone, nor is the mind to be trusted alone. In the conjoint
action of the two, by reason of the mutual checks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
established, a far higher degree of certainty is attained to,
yet even in this, the utmost vouchsafed to the individual,
there is not, as both Greeks and Indians ascertained, an
absolute sureness. It was the knowledge of this which
extorted from them so many melancholy complaints, which
threw them into an intellectual despair, and made them,
by applying the sad determination to which they had
come to the course of their daily life, sink down into
indifference and infidelity.</p>

<p>But yet there is something more in reserve for man.
Let him cast off the clog of individuality, and remember
that he has race connexions&mdash;connexions which, in this
matter of a criterion of truth, indefinitely increase his
chances of certainty. If he looks with contempt on the
opinions of his childhood, with little consideration on
those of his youth, with distrust on those of his manhood,
what will he say about the opinions of his race? Do not
such considerations teach us that, through all these successive
conditions, the criterion of truth is ever advancing in
precision and power, and that its maximum is found in the
unanimous opinion of the whole human race?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Though no absolute criterion exists, a practical one does.</div>

<p>Upon these principles I believe that, though we have
not philosophically speaking, any absolute criterion
of truth, we rise by degrees to higher
and higher certainties along an ascending scale
which becomes more and more exact. I think
that metaphysical writers who have treated of this point
have been led into error from an imperfect conception of
the true position of man; they have limited their thoughts
to a single epoch of his course, and have not taken an
enlarged and philosophical view. In thus declining the
Oriental doctrine that the individual is the centre from
which the universe should be regarded, and transferring
our stand-point to a more comprehensive and solid foundation,
we imitate, in metaphysics, the course of astronomy
when it substituted the heliocentric for the geocentric
point of view, and the change promises to be equally
fertile in sure results. If it were worth while, we might
proceed to enforce this doctrine by an appeal to the experience
of ordinary life. How often, when we distrust
our own judgment, do we seek support in the advice of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
friend. How strong is our persuasion that we are in the
right when public opinion is with us. For this even the
<span class="sidenote">The maximum of certainty in the human race.</span>
Church has not disdained to call together Councils, aiming
thereby at a surer means of arriving at the truth. The
Council is more trustworthy than an individual, whoever he
may be. The probabilities increase with the number of
consenting intellects, and hence I come to the
conclusion that in the unanimous consent of the
entire human race lies the human criterion of
truth&mdash;a criterion, in its turn, capable of increased
precision with the diffusion of enlightenment and
knowledge. For this reason, I do not look upon the
prospects of humanity in so cheerless a light as they did
of old. On the contrary, ever thing seems full of hope.
Good auguries may be drawn for philosophy from the
great mechanical and material inventions which multiply
the means of intercommunication, and, it may be said,
annihilate terrestrial distances. In the intellectual collisions
that must ensue, in the melting down of opinions,
in the examinations and analyses of nations, truth will
come forth. Whatever cannot stand that ordeal must
submit to its fate. Lies and imposture, no matter how
powerfully sustained, must prepare to depart. In that
supreme tribunal man may place implicit confidence.
Even though, philosophically, it is far from absolute, it
is the highest criterion vouchsafed to him, and from its
decision he has no appeal.</p>

<p>In delivering thus emphatically my own views on this
profound topic perhaps I do wrong. It is becoming to
speak with humility on that which has been glorified by
the great writers of Greece, of India, of Alexandria, and,
in later times, of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complete analogy between Greek and Indian process of thought.</div>

<p>In conclusion, I would remark that the view here
presented of the results of Greek philosophy is that which
offers itself to me after a long and careful study of the
subject. It is, however, the affirmative, not
the negative result; for we must not forget
that if, on the one hand, the pantheistic
doctrines of the Nature of God, Universal Animation,
the theory of Emanation, Transmutation,
Absorption, Transmigration, etc., were adopted, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the other there was by no means an insignificant tendency
to atheism and utter infidelity. Even of this negative
state a corresponding condition occurred in the Buddhism
of India, of which I have previously spoken; and, indeed,
so complete is the parallel between the course of mental
evolution in Asia and Europe, that it is difficult to designate
a matter of minor detail in the philosophy of the one
which cannot be pointed out in that of the other. It was
not without reason, therefore, that the Alexandrian philosophers,
who were profoundly initiated in the detail of
both systems, came to the conclusion that such surprising
coincidences could only be accounted for upon the admission
that there had been an ancient revelation, the vestiges
of which had descended to their time. In this, however,
they judged erroneously; the true explanation consisting in
the fact that the process of development of the intellect of
man, and the final results to which he arrives in examining
similar problems, are in all countries the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variation of practical application explained.</div>

<p>It does not fall within my plan to trace the application
of these philosophical principles to practice in daily life,
yet the subject is of such boundless interest that perhaps
the reader will excuse a single paragraph. It may seem
to superficial observation that, whatever might be the
doctrinal resemblances of these philosophies, their application
was very different. In a general way, it
may be asserted that the same doctrines which
in India led to the inculcation of indifference
and quietism, led to Stoic activity in Greece and
Italy. If the occasion permitted, I could, nevertheless,
demonstrate in this apparent divergence an actual coincidence;
for the mode of life of man is chiefly determined
by geographical conditions, his instinctive disposition to
activity increasing with the latitude in which he lives.
Under the equinoctial line he has no disposition for exertion,
his physiological relations with the climate making
quietism most agreeable to him. The philosophical formula
which, in the hot plains of India, finds its issue in a life
of tranquillity and repose, will be interpreted in the more
bracing air of Europe by a life of activity. Thus, in later
ages, the monk of Africa, willingly persuading himself
that any intervention to improve Nature is a revolt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
against the providence of God, spent his worthless life in
weaving baskets and mats, or in solitary meditation in the
caves of the desert of Thebais; but the monk of Europe
encountered the labours of agriculture and social activity,
and thereby aided, in no insignificant manner, in the
civilization of England, France, and Germany. These
things, duly considered, lead to the conclusion that human
life, in its diversities, is dependent upon and determined
by primary conditions in all countries and climates
essentially the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transition from Greece to Europe.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the exposition of the intellectual progress of Greece
given in the preceding pages, we now turn,
agreeably to the plan laid down, to an examination
of that of all Europe. The movement in
that single nation is typical of the movement of the entire
continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">European age of Inquiry.</div>

<p>The first European intellectual age&mdash;that of Credulity&mdash;has
already, in part, been considered in Chapter II., more
especially so far as Greece is concerned. I propose
now, after some necessary remarks in
conclusion of that topic, to enter on the description of the
second European age&mdash;that of Inquiry.</p>

<p>For these remarks, what has already been said of Greece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
prepares the way. Mediterranean Europe was philosophically
and socially in advance of the central and northern
countries. The wave of civilization passed from the south
to the north; in truth, it has hardly yet reached its
extreme limit. The adventurous emigrants who in remote
times had come from Asia left to the successive generations
of their descendants a legacy of hardship. In the struggle
for life, all memory of an Oriental parentage was lost;
knowledge died away; religious ideas became debased;
and the diverse populations sank into the same intellectual
condition that they would have presented had they been
proper autochthons of the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion of the old Europeans.</div>

<p>The religion of the barbarian Europeans was in many
respects like that of the American Indians. They recognized
a Great Spirit&mdash;omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent.
In the earliest times they made no representation
of him under the human form, nor had they
temples; but they propitiated him by sacrifices, offering
animals, as the horse, and even men, upon rude altars.
Though it was believed that this Great Spirit might sometimes
be heard in the sounds of the forests at night, yet,
for the most part, he was too far removed from human
supplication, and hence arose, from the mere sorcerous
ideas of a terrified fancy, as has been the case in so many
other countries, star worship&mdash;the second stage of comparative
theology. The gloom and shade of dense forests, a
solitude that offers an air of sanctity, and seems a fitting
resort for mysterious spirits, suggested the establishment
of sacred groves and holy trees. Throughout Europe there
was a confused idea that the soul exists after the death of
the body; as to its particular state there was a diversity
of belief. As among other people, also, the offices of
religion were not only directed to the present benefit of
individuals, but also to the discovery of future events by
various processes of divination and augury practised among
the priests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their priesthood,</div>

<p>Although the priests had thus charge of the religious
rites, they do not seem to have been organized in
such a manner as to be able to act with unanimity
or to pursue a steady system of policy. A class of female
religious officials&mdash;prophetesses&mdash;joined in the ceremonials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
These holy women, who were held in very great esteem,
prepared the way for the reception of Mariolatry. Instead
of temples&mdash;rock-altars, cromlechs, and other rustic
structures were used among the Celtic nations by the
Druids, who were at the same time priests, magicians, and
medicine-men. Their religious doctrines, which recall in
many particulars those of the Rig-Veda, were perpetuated
from generation to generation by the aid of songs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and objects of adoration.</div>

<p>The essential features of this system were its purely
local form and its want of a well-organized hierarchy.
Even the Celts offer no exception, though they had a
subordination from the Arch-Druid downward. This was
the reason of the weakness of the old faith and eventually
the cause of its fall. When the German nations migrated
to the south in their warlike expeditions, they left behind
them their consecrated groves and sacred oaks, hallowed by
immemorial ages. These objects the devotee
could not carry with him, and no equivalent substitute
could be obtained for them. In the civilized countries
to which they came they met with a very different state of
things; a priesthood thoroughly organized and modelled
according to the ancient Roman political system; its
objects of reverence tied to no particular locality; its
institutions capable of universal action; its sacred writings
easy of transportation anywhere; its emblems moveable to
all countries&mdash;the cross on the standards of its armies, the
crucifix on the bosom of its saints. In the midst of the
<span class="sidenote">Influence of Roman Christianity upon them.</span>
noble architecture of Italy and the splendid remains of
those Romans who had once given laws to the world, in the
midst of a worship distinguished by the magnificence of its
ceremonial and the solemnity of its mysteries,
they found a people whose faith taught them to
regard the present life as offering only a transitory
occupation, and not for a moment to be
weighed against the eternal existence hereafter&mdash;an existence
very different from that of the base transmigration
of Druidism or the Drunken Paradise of Woden, where the
brave solace themselves with mead from cups made of the
skulls of their enemies killed in their days upon earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of Roman history in this investigation.</div>

<p>The European age of inquiry is therefore essentially
connected with Roman affairs. It is distinguished by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
religious direction it took. In place of the dogmas of
rival philosophical schools, we have now to deal
with the tenets of conflicting sects. The whole
history of those unhappy times displays the
organizing and practical spirit characteristic of
Rome. Greek democracy, tending to the decomposition of
things, led to the Sophists and Sceptics. Roman imperialism,
ever constructive, sought to bring unity out of discords,
and draw the line between orthodoxy and heresy by the
authority of councils like that of Nicea. Following the
ideas of St. Augustine in his work, "The City of God," I
adopt, as the most convenient termination of this age, the
sack of Rome by Alaric. This makes it overlap the age
of Faith, which had, as its unmistakable beginning, the
foundation of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Greek intellectual life displays all its phases completely,
but not so was it with that of the Romans, who came to an
untimely end. They were men of violence, who disappeared
in consequence of their own conquests and crimes. The
consumption of them by war bore, however, an insignificant
proportion to that fatal diminution, that mortal
adulteration occasioned by their merging in the vast mass
of humanity with which they came in contact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great difficulty of treating it.</div>

<p>I approach the consideration of Roman affairs, which is
thus the next portion of my task, with no little diffidence.
It is hard to rise to a point of view sufficiently elevated
and clear, where the extent of dominion is so great
geographically, and the reasons of policy are obscured by
the dimness and clouds of so many centuries.
Living in a social state the origin of which is in
the events now to be examined, our mental vision
can hardly free itself from the illusions of historical perspective,
or bring things into their just proportions and
position. Of a thousand acts, all of surpassing interest
and importance, how shall we identify the master ones?
How shall we discern with correctness the true relation of
the parts of this wonderful phenomenon of empire, the
vanishing events of which glide like dissolving views into
each other? Warned by the example of those who have
permitted the shadows of their own imagination to fall
upon the scene, and have mistaken them for a part of it, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
shall endeavour to apply the test of common sense to the
facts of which it will be necessary to treat; and, believing
that man has ever been the same in his modes of thought
and motives of action, I shall judge of past occurrences in
the same way as of those of our own times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Triple form of Roman power.</div>

<p>In its entire form the Roman power consists of two
theocracies, with a military domination intercalated.
The first of these theocracies corresponds to
the fabulous period of the kings; the military
domination to the time of the republic and earlier Cæsars;
the second theocracy to that of the Christian emperors
and the Popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first theocracy and legendary times.</div>

<p>The first theocracy is so enveloped in legends and
fictions that it is impossible to give a satisfactory account
of it. The biographies of the kings offer such undeniable
evidence of being mere romances, that, since the time of
Niebuhr, they have been received by historians in that
light. But during the reigns of the pagan
emperors it was not safe in Rome to insinuate
publicly any disbelief in such honoured legends
as those of the wolf that suckled the foundlings;
the ascent of Romulus into heaven; the nymph
Egeria; the duel of the Horatii and Curiatii; the leaping
of Curtius into the gulf on his horse; the cutting of a flint
with a razor by Tarquin; the Sibyl and her books. The
modern historian has, therefore, only very little reliable
material. He may admit that the Romans and Sabines
coalesced; that they conquered the Albans and Latins;
<span class="sidenote">Early Roman history.</span>
that thousands of the latter were transplanted to Mount
Aventine and made plebeians; these movements being the
origin of the castes which long afflicted Rome,
the vanquished people constituting a subordinate
class; that at first the chief occupation was
agriculture, the nature of which is not only to accustom
men to the gradations of rank, such as the proprietor of
the land, the overseer, the labourer, but also to the
cultivation of religious sentiment, and even the cherishing
of superstition; that, besides the more honourable
occupations in which the rising state was engaged, she
had, from the beginning, indulged in aggressive war, and
was therefore perpetually liable to reprisal&mdash;one of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
first acts was the founding of the town of Ostia, at the
mouth of the Tiber, on account of piracy; that, through
some conspiracy in the army, indicated in the legend of
Lucretia, since armies have often been known to do such
things, the kings were expelled, and a military domination
fancifully called a republic, but consisting of a league of
some powerful families, arose.</p>

<p>Throughout the regal times, and far into the republican,
the chief domestic incidents turn on the strife of the upper
caste or patricians with the lower or plebeians, manifesting
itself by the latter asserting their right to a share
in the lands conquered by their valour; by the extortion
of the Valerian law; by the admission of the Latins and
Hernicans to conditions of equality; by the transference of
the election of tribunes from the centuries to the tribes; by
the repeal of the law prohibiting the marriage of plebeians
with patricians and by the eventual concession to the former
of the offices of consul, dictator, censor, and prætor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The domestic necessity for foreign war.</div>

<p>In these domestic disputes we see the origin of the
Roman necessity for war. The high caste is
steadily diminishing in number, the low caste
as steadily increasing. In imperious pride, the
patrician fills his private jail with debtors and delinquents;
he usurps the lands that have been conquered.
Insurrection is the inevitable consequence, foreign war
the only relief. As the circle of operations extends, both
parties see their interest in a cordial coalescence on equal
terms, and jointly tyrannize exteriorly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual spread of Roman influence to the south.</div>

<p>The geographical dominion of Rome was extended at
first with infinite difficulty. Up to the time of the capture
of the city by the Gauls a doubtful existence was maintained
in perpetual struggles with the adjacent towns
and chieftains. There is reason to believe that in the
very infancy of the republic, in the contest that ensued
upon the expulsion of the kings, the city was taken by
Porsenna. The direction in which her influence first
spread was toward the south of the peninsula.
Tarentum, one of the southern states, brought
over to its assistance Pyrrhus the Epirot. He
did little in the way of assisting his allies&mdash;he
only saw Rome from the Acropolis of Præneste; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
from him the Romans learned the art of fortifying camps,
and caught the idea of invading Sicily. Here the rising
republic came in contact with the Carthaginians, and in
the conflict that ensued discovered the military value
of Spain and Gaul, from which the Carthaginians drew
<span class="sidenote">Rome builds a navy,</span>
an immense supply of mercenaries and munitions of war.
The advance to greatness which Rome now made was
prodigious. She saw that everything turned
on the possession of the sea, and with admirable
energy built a navy. In this her expectations were
more than realized. The assertion is quite true that she
spent more time in acquiring a little earth in Italy than
<span class="sidenote">and invades Africa.</span>
was necessary for subduing the world after she had once
obtained possession of the Mediterranean. From the experience
of Agathocles she learned that the true method of
controlling Carthage was by invading Africa.
The principles involved in the contest, and the
position of Rome at its close, are shown by the terms of
the treaty of the first Punic War&mdash;that Carthage should
<span class="sidenote">Results of the first Punic War.</span>
evacuate every island in the Mediterranean, and
pay a war-fine of six hundred thousand pounds.
In her devotion to the acquisition of wealth
Carthage had become very rich; she had reached a high
state of cultivation of art; yet her prosperity, or rather
the mode by which she had attained it, had greatly
weakened her, as also had the political anomaly under
which she was living, for it is an anomaly that an Asiatic
people should place itself under democratic forms. Her
condition in this respect was evidently the consequence of
her original subordinate position as a Tyrian trading
station, her rich men having long been habituated to look
to the mother city for distinction. As in other commercial
states, her citizens became soldiers with reluctance,
and hence she had often to rely on mercenary troops.
From her the Romans received lessons of the utmost
importance. She confirmed them in the estimate they
had formed of the value of naval power; taught them
how to build ships properly and handle them; how to
make military roads. The tribes of Northern Italy were
hardly included in the circle of Roman dominion when a
fleet was built in the Adriatic, and, under the pretence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
putting down piracy, the sea power of the Illyrians was
extinguished. From time immemorial the Mediterranean
had been infested with pirates; man-stealing had been
a profitable occupation, great gains being realized by
ransoms of captives, or by selling them at Delos or other
slave-markets. At this time it was clear that the final
<span class="sidenote">Results of the second Punic War.</span>
mastery of the Mediterranean turned on the possession of
Spain, the great silver-producing country. The rivalry
for Spain occasioned the second Punic War. It is needless
to repeat the well-known story of Hannibal,
how he brought Rome to the brink of ruin.
The relations she maintained with surrounding
communities had been such that she could not trust to
them. Her enemy found allies in many of the Greek
towns in the south of Italy. It is enough for us to look
at the result of that conflict in the treaty that closed it.
Carthage had to give up all her ships of war except ten
triremes, to bind herself to enter into no war without the
consent of the Roman people, and to pay a war-fine of two
<span class="sidenote">Rome invades Greece,</span>
millions of pounds. Rome now entered, on the great
scale, on the policy of disorganizing states for the purpose
of weakening them. Under pretext of an invitation
from the Athenians to protect them from the King of
Macedon, the ambitious republic secured a footing
in Greece, the principle developed in the
invasion of Africa of making war maintain war being
again resorted to. There may have been truth in the
Roman accusation that the intrigues of Hannibal with
<span class="sidenote">and compels the cession of all the European provinces of
Antiochus.<br /><br />Revolt of Perses.</span>
Antiochus, king of Syria, occasioned the conflict between
Rome and that monarch. Its issue was a prodigious event
in the material aggrandizement of Rome&mdash;it was the
cession of all his possessions in Europe and those of Asia
north of Mount Taurus, with a war-fine of
three millions of pounds. Already were seen
the effects of the wealth that was pouring into
Italy in the embezzlement of the public money
by the Scipios. The resistance of Perses, king
of Macedon, could not restore independence to Greece;
it ended in the annexation of that country,
Epirus and Illyricum. The results of this war
were to the last degree pernicious to the victors and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
vanquished; the moral greatness of the former is truly
affirmed to have disappeared, and the social ruin of the
latter was so complete that for long marriage was replaced
by concubinage. The policy and practices of
Rome now literally became infernal; she forced a quarrel
upon her old antagonist Carthage, and the third Punic
<span class="sidenote">Dreadful social effects on Rome.</span>
War resulted in the utter destruction of that city.
Simultaneously her oppressions in Greece
provoked revolt, which was ended by the sack
and burning of Corinth, Thebes, Chalcis, and
the transference of the plundered statues, paintings, and
works of art to Italy. There was nothing now in the
way of the conquest of Spain except the valour of its
<span class="sidenote">Plunder of Greece and annexation of Spain.</span>
inhabitants. After the assassination of Viriatus, procured
by the Consul Cæpio, and the horrible
siege of Numantia, that country was annexed
as a province. Next we see the gigantic republic
extending itself over the richest parts of
Asia Minor, through the insane bequest of Attalus, king
of Pergamus. The wealth of Africa, Spain, Greece, and
Asia, was now concentrating in Italy, and the capital was
becoming absolutely demoralized. In vain the Gracchi
<span class="sidenote">Seizure of Asia Minor.<br /><br />
The Servile and Social wars.</span>
attempted to apply a remedy. The Roman aristocracy
was intoxicated, insatiate, irresistible. The
middle class was gone; there was nothing but
profligate nobles and a diabolical populace. In the midst
of inconceivable corruption, the Jugurthine War served
only to postpone for a moment an explosion which was
inevitable. The Servile rebellion in Sicily broke out; it
was closed by the extermination of a million of
those unhappy wretches: vast numbers of them
were exposed, for the popular amusement, to
the wild beasts in the arena. It was followed closely by
the revolt of the Italian allies, known as the Social War&mdash;this
ending, after the destruction of half a million of men,
with a better result, in the extortion of the freedom of
the city by several of the revolting states. Doubtless it
was the intrigues connected with these transactions that
brought the Cimbri and Teutons into Italy, and furnished
an opening for the rivalries of Marius and Sylla, who, in
turn, filled Rome with slaughter. The same spirit broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
out under the gladiator Spartacus: it was only checked
for a time by resorting to the most awful atrocities, such
as the crucifixion of prisoners, to appear under another
<span class="sidenote">Gradual convergence of power.</span>
form in the conspiracy of Catiline. And now it was
plain that the contest for supreme power lay between a
few leading men. It found an issue in the first
triumvirate&mdash;a union of Pompey, Crassus, and
Cæsar, who usurped the whole power of the
senate and people, and bound themselves by oath to
permit nothing to be done without their unanimous
<span class="sidenote">Cæsar the master of the world.</span>
consent. Affairs then passed through their inevitable
course. The death of Crassus and the battle
of Pharsalia left Cæsar the master of the world.
At this moment nothing could have prevented
the inevitable result. The dagger of Brutus merely
removed a man, but it left the fact. The battle of
Actium reaffirmed the destiny of Rome, and the death of
the republic was illustrated by the annexation of Egypt.
The circle of conquest around the Mediterranean was
complete; the function of the republic was discharged: it
did not pass away prematurely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient necessity for slave-wars.</div>

<p>From this statement of the geographical career of Rome,
we may turn to reflect on the political principles which
inspired her. From a remote antiquity wars had been
engaged in for the purpose of obtaining a
supply of labour, the conqueror compelling those
whom he had spared to cultivate his fields and
serve him as slaves. Under a system of transitory military
domination, it was more expedient to exhaust a people at
once by the most unsparing plunder than to be content
with a tribute periodically paid, but necessarily uncertain
in the vicissitudes of years. These elementary principles
of the policy of antiquity were included by the Romans in
their system with modifications and improvements.</p>

<p>The republic, during its whole career, illustrates the
observation that the system on which it was founded
included no conception of the actual relations of man.
It dealt with him as a thing, not as a being endowed
with inalienable rights. Recognizing power as its only
measure of value, it could never accept the principle of
the equality of all men in the eye of the law. The subjugation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of Sicily, Africa, Greece, was quickly followed by
<span class="sidenote">Depopulation of countries after Roman conquest.</span>
the depopulation of those countries, as Livy,
Plutarch, Strabo, and Polybius testify. Can
there be a more fearful instance than the
conduct of Paulus Æmilius, who, at the conquest
of Epirus, murdered or carried into slavery 150,000
persons? At the taking of Thebes whole families were
thus disposed of, and these not of the lower, but of the
respectable kind, of whom it has been significantly said
that they were transported into Italy to be melted down.
In Italy itself the consumption of life was so great that
<span class="sidenote">Atrocity of the Roman slave-laws.</span>
there was no possibility of the slaves by birth meeting
the requirement, and the supply of others by war became
necessary. To these slaves the laws were atrociously
unjust. Tacitus has recorded that on
the occasion of the murder of Pedanius, after
a solemn debate in the senate, the particulars of which
he furnishes, the ancient laws were enforced, and four
hundred slaves of the deceased were put to death, when it
was obvious to every one that scarcely any of them had
known of the crime. The horrible maxim that not only
the slaves within a house in which a master was murdered,
but even those within a circle supposed to be measured by
the reach of his voice, should be put to death, shows us
the small value of the life of these unfortunates, and the
facility with which they could be replaced. Their vast
numbers necessarily made every citizen a soldier; the
<span class="sidenote">Social effects of the Roman slave-system.</span>
culture of the land and the manufacturing processes, the
pursuits of labour and industry, were assigned
to them with contempt. The relation of the
slave in such a social system is significantly
shown by the fact that the courts estimated the amount of
any injury he had received by the damage his master had
thereby sustained. To such a degree had this system
been developed, that slave labour was actually cheaper
than animal labour, and, as a consequence, much of the
work that we perform by cattle was then done by men.
The class of independent hirelings, which should have
constituted the chief strength of the country, disappeared,
labour itself becoming so ignoble that the poor citizen could
not be an artisan, but must remain a pauper&mdash;a sturdy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
beggar, expecting from the state bread and amusements.
The personal uncleanness and shiftless condition
of these lower classes were the true causes of the prevalence
of leprosy and other loathsome diseases. Attempts
at sanitary improvement were repeatedly made, but they
so imperfectly answered the purpose that epidemics, occurring
from time to time, produced a dreadful mortality.
Even under the Cæsars, after all that had been done, there
was no essential amendment. The assertion is true that
the Old World never recovered from the great plague in
the time of M. Antoninus, brought by the army from
the Parthian War. In the reign of Titus ten thousand
persons died in one day in Rome.</p>

<p>The slave system bred that thorough contempt for trade
which animated the Romans. They never grudged even
the Carthaginians a market. It threw them into
the occupation of the demagogue, making them spend
their lives, when not engaged in war, in the intrigues
of political factions, the turbulence of public
elections, the excitement of lawsuits. They were the
first to discover that the privilege of interpreting laws is
nearly equal to that of making them; and to this has been
rightly attributed their turn for jurisprudence, and the
prosperity of advocates among them. The disappearance
of the hireling class was the immediate cause of the
downfall of the republic and the institution of the empire,
for the aristocracy were left without any antagonist, and
therefore without any restraint. They broke up into
factions, involving the country in civil war by their
struggles with each other for power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The war system.</div>

<p>The political maxims of the republic, for the most part,
rejected the ancient system of devastating a vanquished
state by an instant, unsparing, and crushing plunder,
which may answer very well where the tenure is expected
to be brief, but does not accord with the formula
subdue, retain, advance. Yet depopulation was
the necessary incident. Italy, Sicily, Asia Minor, Gaul,
Germany, were full of people, but they greatly diminished
under Roman occupation. Her maxims were capable of
being realized with facility through her military organization,
particularly that of the legion. In some nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
colonies are founded for commercial purposes, in others
for getting rid of an excess of population: the Roman
colony implies the idea of a garrison and an active military
intent. Each legion was, in fact, so constructed as to be
a small but complete army. In whatever country it might
be encamped, it was in quick communication with the
head-quarters at Rome; and this not metaphorically, but
materially, as was shown by the building of the necessary
military roads. The idea of permanent occupation, which
was thus implied, did not admit the expediency of devastating
a country, but, on the contrary, led to the
encouragement of provincial prosperity, because the
greater the riches the greater the capacity for taxation.
Such principles were in harmony with the conditions of
solidity and security of the Roman power, which proverbially
had not risen in a single day&mdash;was not the
creation of a single fortunate soldier, but represented the
settled policy of many centuries. In the act of conquest
Rome was inhuman; she tried to strike a blow that there
would never be any occasion to repeat; no one was spared
who by possibility might inconvenience her; but, the
catastrophe once over, as a general thing, the vanquished
had no occasion to complain of her rule. Of course, in the
shadow of public justice, private wrong and oppression
were often concealed. Through injustice and extortion, her
officers accumulated enormous fortunes, which have never
since been equalled in Europe. Sometimes the like occurred
in times of public violence; thus Brutus made Asia Minor
pay five years' tribute at once, and shortly after Antony
compelled it to do it again. The extent to which recognized
and legitimate exactions were carried is shown by
the fact that upon the institution of the empire the annual
revenues were about forty millions of pounds sterling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of gold and silver.</div>

<p>The comparative value of metals in Rome is a significant
political indication. Bullion rapidly increased in amount
during the Carthaginian wars. At the opening
of the first Punic War silver and copper were as
1 to 960; at the second Punic War the ratio had fallen,
and was 1 to 160; soon after there was another fall, and
it became 1 to 128. The republic debased the coinage
by reducing its weight, the empire by alloying it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Connexion between debasement of
coinage and political decline.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
The science, art, and political condition of nations are
often illustrated by their coinage. An interesting view
of the progress of Europe might be obtained from a
philosophical study of its numismatic remains. The
simplicity of the earlier ages is indicated by the pure silver,
such as that coined at Crotona, <small>B.C.</small> 600&mdash;that
of the reign of Philip of Macedon by the native
unalloyed gold. A gradual decline in Roman
prosperity is more than shadowed forth by the
gradual deterioration of its money; for, as evil
times befell the state, the emperors were compelled to
utter a false coinage. Thus, under Vespasian, <small>A.D.</small> 69, the
silver money contained about one fourth of its weight of
copper; under Antoninus Pius, <small>A.D.</small> 138, more than one
third; under Commodus, <small>A.D.</small> 180, nearly one half; under
Gordian, <small>A.D.</small> 236, there was added to the silver more than
twice its weight of copper. Nay, under Gallienus, a
coinage was issued of copper, tin and silver, in which
the first two metals exceed the last by more than two
hundred times its weight. It shows to what a hopeless
condition the state had come.</p>

<p>The Roman demagogues, as is the instinct of their
kind, made political capital by attacking industrial capital.
They lowered the rate of interest, prohibited interest, and
often attempted the abolition of debts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indescribable depravity in the Roman decline.</div>

<p>The concentration of power and increase of immorality
proceeded with an equal step. In its earlier ages, the
Roman dominion was exercised by a few thousand persons;
then it passed into the hands of some score
families; then it was sustained for a moment
by individuals, and at last was seized by one
man, who became the master of 120 millions.
As the process went on, the virtues which had adorned
the earlier times disappeared, and in the end were replaced
by crimes such as the world had never before witnessed
and never will again. An evil day is approaching when
it becomes recognized in a community that the only
standard of social distinction is wealth. That day was
soon followed in Rome by its unavoidable consequence, a
government founded upon two domestic elements, corruption
and terrorism. No language can describe the state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of that capital after the civil wars. The accumulation of
power and wealth gave rise to a universal depravity.
Law ceased to be of any value. A suitor must deposit a
bribe before a trial could be had. The social fabric was
a festering mass of rottenness. The people had become a
populace; the aristocracy was demoniac; the city was a
hell. No crime that the annals of human wickedness
can show was left unperpetrated&mdash;remorseless murders;
<span class="sidenote">Dissoluteness of the women, and avoidance of marriage.</span>
the betrayal of parents, husbands, wives, friends; poisoning
reduced to a system; adultery degenerating
into incests, and crimes that cannot be written.
Women of the higher class were so lascivious,
depraved, and dangerous, that men could not be
compelled to contract matrimony with them; marriage
was displaced by concubinage; even virgins were guilty
of inconceivable immodesties; great officers of state and
ladies of the court, of promiscuous bathings and naked exhibitions.
In the time of Cæsar it had become necessary for
the government to interfere, and actually put a premium
on marriage. He gave rewards to women who had many
children; prohibited those who were under forty-five years
of age, and who had no children, from wearing jewels and
riding in litters, hoping by such social disabilities to
correct the evil. It went on from bad to worse, so that
Augustus, in view of the general avoidance of legal
marriage and resort to concubinage with slaves, was
compelled to impose penalties on the unmarried&mdash;to enact
that they should not inherit by will except from relations.
Not that the Roman women refrained from the gratification
of their desires; their depravity impelled them to
such wicked practices as cannot be named in a modern
book. They actually reckoned the years, not by the
consuls, but by the men they had lived with. To be
childless, and therefore without the natural restraint of a
family, was looked upon as a singular felicity. Plutarch
correctly touched the point when he said that the Romans
married to be heirs and not to have heirs. Of offences that
do not rise to the dignity of atrocity, but which excite our
loathing, such as gluttony and the most debauched luxury,
the annals of the times furnish disgusting proofs. It was
said, "They eat that they may vomit, and vomit that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
may eat." At the taking of Perusium, three hundred of
the most distinguished citizens were solemnly sacrificed at
the altar of Divus Julius by Octavian! Are these the
deeds of civilized men, or the riotings of cannibals drunk
with blood?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The whole system is past cure.</div>

<p>The higher classes on all sides exhibited a total extinction
of moral principle; the lower were
practical atheists. Who can peruse the annals
of the emperors without being shocked at the
manner in which men died, meeting their fate with the
obtuse tranquillity that characterizes beasts? A centurion
with a private mandate appears, and forthwith the victim
opens his veins and dies in a warm bath. At the best, all
that was done was to strike at the tyrant. Men despairingly
acknowledged that the system itself was utterly
past cure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Testimony of Tacitus.</div>

<p>That in these statements I do not exaggerate, hear
what Tacitus says: "The holy ceremonies of religion
were violated; adultery reigning without control; the
adjacent islands filled with exiles; rocks and desert places
stained with clandestine murders, and Rome itself
a theatre of horrors, where nobility of descent
and splendour of fortune marked men out for destruction;
where the vigour of mind that aimed at civil dignities,
and the modesty that declined them, were offences without
distinction; where virtue was a crime that led to
certain ruin; where the guilt of informers and the wages
of their iniquity were alike detestable; where the sacerdotal
order, the consular dignity, the government of
provinces, and even the cabinet of the prince, were seized
by that execrable race as their lawful prey; where
nothing was sacred, nothing safe from the hand of
rapacity; where slaves were suborned, or by their own
malevolence excited against their masters; where freemen
betrayed their patrons, and he who had lived without
an enemy died by the treachery of a friend."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects in the provinces. Free trade.</div>

<p>But, though these were the consequences of the concentration
of power and wealth in the city of
Rome, it was otherwise in the expanse of the
empire. The effect of Roman domination was the
cessation of all the little wars that had heretofore been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
waged between adjacent peoples. They exchanged independence
for peace. Moreover, and this, in the end, was
of the utmost importance to them all, unrestricted commerce
ensued, direct trade arising between all parts of the
empire. The Mediterranean nations were brought closer
to each other, and became common inheritors of such
knowledge as was then in the world. Arts, sciences,
improved agriculture, spread among them; the most
distant countries could boast of noble roads, aqueducts,
bridges, and great works of engineering. In barbarous
places, the legions that were intended as garrisons proved
to be foci of civilization. For the provinces, even the
wickedness of Rome was not without some good. From
one quarter corn had to be brought; from another,
clothing; from another, luxuries; and Italy had to pay
for it all in coin. She had nothing to export in return.
By this there was a tendency to equalization of wealth
in all parts of the empire, and a perpetual movement
<span class="sidenote">Intellectual advancements.</span>
of money. Nor was the advantage altogether material;
there were conjoined intellectual results of no
little value. Superstition and the amazing
credulity of the old times disappeared. In the first Punic
War, Africa was looked upon as a land of monsters; it
had serpents large enough to stop armies, it had headless
men. Sicily had its Cyclops, giants, enchantresses; golden
apples grew in Spain; the mouth of Hell was on the shores
of the Euxine. The marches of the legions and the voyages
of merchants made all these phantasms vanish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disappearance of the Roman ethnical element.</div>

<p>It was the necessary consequence of her military aggrandizement
that the ethnical element which
really constituted Rome should expire. A small
nucleus of men had undertaken to conquer the
Mediterranean world, and had succeeded. In
doing this they had diffused themselves over an immense
geographical surface, and necessarily became lost in the
mass with which they mingled. On the other hand, the
deterioration of Italy was insured by the slave system,
and the ruin of Rome was accomplished before the barbarians
touched it. Whoever inquires the cause of the fall
of the Roman empire will find his answer in ascertaining
what had become of the Romans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman conquest produces homogeneous thought,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
The extinction of prodigies and superstitious legends was
occasioned by increased travel, through the merging of many
separate nations into one great empire. Intellectual
communication attends material communication.
The spread of Roman influence around
the borders of the Mediterranean produced a tendency
to homogeneous thought eminently dangerous to the
many forms of faith professed by so many different people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and revolutionizes religious ideas.</div>

<p>After Tarquin was expelled the sacerdotal class became
altogether subordinate to the military, whose whole history
shows that they regarded religion as a mere state institution,
without any kind of philosophical significance, and
chiefly to be valued for the control it furnished over vulgar
minds. It presented itself to them in the light of a branch
of industry, from which profit might be made by those
who practised it. They thought no more of concerning themselves
individually about it than in taking an interest
in any other branch of lucrative trade. As to any examination
of its intellectual basis, they were not sophists,
but soldiers, blindly following the prescribed
institutions of their country with as little
question as its military commands. For these
reasons, throughout the time of the republic, and also under
the early emperors, there never was much reluctance to
the domestication of any kind of worship in Rome. Indeed,
the gods of the conquered countries were established there
to the gratification of the national vanity. From this
commingling of worship in the city, and intercommunication
of ideas in the provinces, the most important events
arose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imperialism prepares the way for monotheism.</div>

<p>For it very soon was apparent that the political unity
which had been established over so great a geographical
surface was the forerunner of intellectual, and
therefore religious unity. Polytheism became
practically inconsistent with the Roman empire,
and a tendency arose for the introduction of
some form of monotheism. Apart from the operations of
Reason, it is clear that the recognition by so many nations
of one emperor must soon be followed by the acknowledgment
of one God. There is a disposition to uniformity
among people who are associated by a common political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bond. Moreover, the rivalries of a hundred priesthoods
imparted to polytheism an intrinsic weakness; but monotheism
implies centralization, an organized hierarchy, and
therefore concentration of power. The different interests
and collisions of multitudinous forms of religion sapped
individual faith; a diffusion of practical atheism, manifested
by a total indifference to all ceremonies, except so far as
they were shows, was the result, the whole community
falling into an unbelieving and godless state. The form
of superstition through which the national mind had passed
was essentially founded upon the recognition of an incessant
intervention of many divinities determining human affairs;
but such a faith became extinct by degrees among the
educated. How was it possible that human reason should
deal otherwise with all the contradictions and absurdities
of a thousand indigenous and imported deities, each
asserting his inconsistent pretensions. A god who in his
native grove or temple has been paramount and unquestioned,
sinks into insignificance when he is brought
into a crowd of compeers. In this respect there is no
difference between gods and men. Great cities are great
levellers of both. He who has stood forth in undue
proportions in the solitude of the country, sinks out of
observation in the solitude of a crowd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roman philosophy.<br /><br />
Varro. Lucretius.</div>

<p>The most superficial statement of philosophy among the
Romans, if philosophy it can be called, shows us how
completely religious sentiment was effaced. The
presence of sceptical thought is seen in the
explanations of Terentius Varro, <small>B.C.</small> 110, that the anthropomorphic
gods are to be received as mere emblems of the
forces of matter; and the general tendency of the times
may be gathered from the poem of Lucretius:
his recommendations that the mind should be
emancipated from the fear of the gods; his arguments
against the immortality of the soul; his setting forth
Nature as the only God to be worshipped. In Cicero
we see how feeble and wavering a guide to life in a
period of trouble philosophy had become, and how one
who wished to stand in the attitude of chief thinker of his
times was no more than a servile copyist of Grecian
predecessors, giving to his works not an air of masculine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Cicero.</span>
and independent thought, but aiming at present effect
rather than a solid durability; for Cicero addresses
himself more to the public than to philosophers,
exhibiting herein his professional tendency as an advocate.
Under a thin veil he hides an undisguised scepticism, and,
with the instinct of a placeman, leans rather to the investigation
of public concerns than to the profound and abstract
topics of philosophy. As is the case with superficial men, he
sees no difference between the speculative and the exact,
confusing them together. He feels that it is inexpedient to
communicate truth publicly, especially that of a religious
kind. Doubtless herein we shall agree when we find that
he believes God to be nothing more than the soul of the
world; discovers many serious objections to the doctrine
of Providence; insinuates that the gods are only poetical
creations; is uncertain whether the soul be immortal, but
is clear that popular doctrine of punishment in the world
to come is only an idle fable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quintus Sextius. Seneca.</div>

<p>It was the attribute of the Romans to impress upon
every thing a practical character. In their philosophy we
continually see this displayed, along with a
striking inferiority in original thought. Quintus
Sextius admonishes us to pursue a virtuous life, and, as an
aid thereto, enjoins an abstinence from meat. In this
opinion many of the Cynical school acquiesced, and some
it is said, even joined the Brahmans. In the troublous
times of the first Cæsars, men had occasion to derive all the
support they could from philosophy; there was no religion
to sustain them. Among the Stoics there were some, as
Seneca, to whom we can look back with pleasure. Through
his writings he exercised a considerable influence on
subsequent ages, though, when we attentively read his
works, we must attribute this not so much to their
intrinsic value as to their happening to coincide with the
prevalent tone of religious thought. He enforces the
<span class="sidenote">Epictetus. Antoninus.</span>
necessity of a cultivation of good morals, and yet he writes
against the religion of his country, its observances, and
requirements. Of a far higher grade was Epictetus, at
once a slave and a philosopher, though scarcely
to be classed as a true Stoic. He considers man
as a mere spectator of God and his works, and teaches that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
every one who can no longer bear the miseries of life is
upon just deliberation, and a conscientious belief that the
gods will not disapprove, free to commit suicide. His
maxim is that all have a part to play, and he has done
well who has done his best&mdash;that he must look to conscience
as his guide. If Seneca said that time alone is our absolute
and only possession, and that nothing else belongs to man,
Epictetus taught that his thoughts are all that man has
any power over, every thing else being beyond his control.
M. Aurelius Antoninus, the emperor, did not hesitate to
acknowledge his thankfulness to Epictetus, the slave, in
his attempt to guide his life according to the principles of
the Stoics. He recommends every man to preserve his
dæmon free from sin, and prefers religious devotions to
the researches of physics, in this departing to some extent
from the original doctrines of the sect; but the evil times
<span class="sidenote">Maximus Tyrius</span>
on which men had fallen led them to seek support in
religious consolations rather than in philosophical
inquiries. In Maximus Tyrius, <small>A.D.</small> 146, we
discover a corresponding sentiment, enveloped, it is true,
in an air of Platonism, and countenancing an impression
that image worship and sanctuaries are unnecessary for
those who have a lively remembrance of the view they
<span class="sidenote">Alexander of Aphrodisias.</span>
once enjoyed of the divine, though excellent for the vulgar,
who have forgotten their past. Alexander of
Aphrodisias exhibits the tendency, which was
becoming very prevalent, to combine Plato and Aristotle.
He treats upon Providence, both absolute and contingent;
considers its bearings upon religion, and shows a disposition
to cultivate the pious feelings of the age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient Physicians.</div>

<p>Galen, the physician, asserts that experience is the only
source of knowledge; lays great stress on the culture
of mathematics and logic, observing that he
himself should have been a Pyrrhonist had it not been for
geometry. In the teleological doctrine of physiology he
considers that the foundations of a true theology must be
laid. The physicians of the times exerted no little influence
on the promotion of such views; for the most part they
embraced the Pantheistic doctrine. As one of them, Sextus
Empiricus may be mentioned; his works, still remaining,
indicate to us the tendency of this school to materialism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophical atheism among the educated.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Such was the tone of thought among the cultivated
Romans; and to this philosophical atheism among them
was added an atheism of indifference among the vulgar.
But, since man is so constituted that he cannot live for
any length of time without a form of worship, it
is evident that there was great danger, whenever
events should be ripe for the appearance of
some monotheistic idea, that it might come in
a base aspect. At a much later period than that we are
here considering, one of the emperors expressed himself to
the effect that it would be necessary to give liberty for the
exercise of a sound philosophy among the higher classes,
and provide a gorgeous ceremonial for the lower; he saw
how difficult it is, by mere statesmanship to co-ordinate
two such requirements, in their very nature contradictory.
Though polytheism had lost all intellectual strength, the
nations who had so recently parted with it could not
be expected to have ceased from all disposition to an
animalization of religion and corporealization of God. In
a certain sense the emperor was only a more remote and
more majestic form of the conquered and vanished kings,
but, like them, he was a man. There was danger that the
theological system, thus changing with the political, would
yield only expanded anthropomorphic conceptions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Principles, to be effective, must coincide with existing tendencies.</div>

<p>History perpetually demonstrates that nations cannot
be permanently modified except by principles or actions
conspiring with their existing tendency. Violence perpetrated
upon them may pass away, leaving, perhaps in a
few generations, no vestige of itself. Even Victory is
conquered by Time. Profound changes only ensue when
the operating force is in unison with the temper
of the age. International peace among so many
people once in conflict&mdash;peace under the auspices
of a great overshadowing power; the unity of
sentiment and brotherhood of feeling fast finding its way
around the Mediterranean shores; the interests of a vast
growing commerce, unfettered through the absorption of
so many little kingdoms into one great republic, were
silently bringing things to a condition that political force
could be given to any religious dogma founded upon
sentiments of mutual regard and interest. Nor could it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
be otherwise than that among the great soldiers of those
times one would at last arise whose practical intellect
would discover the personal advantages that must accrue
from putting himself in relation with the universally
prevailing idea. How could he better find adherents from
the centre to the remotest corner of the empire? And,
even if his own personal intellectual state should disable
him from accepting in its fulness the special form in which
the idea had become embodied, could there be any doubt,
if he received it, and was true to it as a politician, though
he might decline it as a man, of the immense power it
would yield him in return&mdash;a power sufficient, if the
metropolis should resist, or be otherwise unsuited to his
designs, to enable him to found a rival to her in a more
congenial place, and leave her to herself, "the skeleton of
so much glory and of so much guilt."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The coming Monotheism must be bounded by the limits of Roman influence.</div>

<p>Thus, after the event, we can plainly see that the final
blow to Polytheism was the suppression of the ancient
independent nationalities around the Mediterranean Sea;
and that, in like manner, Monotheism was the
result of the establishment of an imperial government
in Rome. But the great statesmen of those
times, who were at the general point of view,
must have foreseen that, in whatever form the
expected change came, its limits of definition would inevitably
be those of the empire itself, and that wherever
the language of Rome was understood the religion of Rome
would prevail. In the course of ages, an expansion beyond
those limits might ensue wherever the state of things was
congenial. On the south, beyond the mere verge of Africa,
nothing was to be hoped for&mdash;it is the country in which
man lives in degradation and is happy. On the east there
were great unsubdued and untouched monarchies, having
their own types of civilization, and experiencing no want
in a religious respect. But on the north there were
nations who, though they were plunged in hideous barbarism,
filthy in an equal degree in body and mind,
polygamists, idolaters, drunkards out of their enemies'
skulls, were yet capable of an illustrious career. For
these there was a glorious participation in store.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new ideas coalesce with the old.</div>

<p>Except the death of a nation, there is no event in human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
history more profoundly solemn than the passing away of
an ancient religion, though religious ideas are transitory,
and creeds succeed one another with a periodicity determined
by the law of continuous variation of human
thought. The intellectual epoch at which we have now
arrived has for its essential characteristic such a change&mdash;the
abandonment of a time-honoured but obsolete
system, the acceptance of a new and living one;
and, in the incipient stages, opinion succeeding
opinion in a well-marked way, until at length, after a few
centuries of fusion and solution, there crystallized on the
remnant of Roman power, as on a nucleus, a definite form,
which, slowly modifying itself into the Papacy, served
the purposes of Europe for more than a thousand years
throughout its age of Faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of the Roman educated men at this period.</div>

<p>In this abandonment, the personal conduct of the educated
classes very powerfully assisted. They outwardly
conformed to the ceremonial of the times, reserving their
higher doctrines to themselves, as something beyond
vulgar comprehension. Considering themselves as an intellectual
aristocracy, they stood aloof, and, with
an ill-concealed smile, consented to the transparent
folly around them. It had come to an
evil state when authors like Polybius and Strabo
apologized to their compeers for the traditions and legends
they ostensibly accepted, on the ground that it is inconvenient
and needless to give popular offence, and that
those who are children in understanding must, like those
who are children in age, be kept in order by bugbears. It
had come to an evil state when the awful ceremonial of
former times had degenerated into a pageant, played off by
an infidel priesthood and unbelieving aristocracy; when
oracles were becoming mute, because they could no longer
withstand the sly wit of the initiated; when the miracles
of the ancients were regarded as mere lies, and of contemporaries
as feats of legerdemain. It had come to an evil
pass when even statesmen received it as a maxim that
when the people have advanced in intellectual culture to a
certain point, the sacerdotal class must either deceive them
or oppress them, if it means to keep its power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious condition of the intellectual classes in Rome.</div>

<p>In Rome, at the time of Augustus, the intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
classes&mdash;philosophers and statesmen&mdash;had completely
emerged from the ancient modes of thought. To them,
the national legends, so jealously guarded by
the populace, had become mere fictions. The
miraculous conception of Rhea Sylvia by the god
Mars, an event from which their ancestors had
deduced with pride the celestial origin of the founder of
their city, had dwindled into a myth; as a source of actual
reliance and trust, the intercession of Venus, that emblem
of female loveliness, with the father of the gods in behalf
of her human favourites, was abandoned; the Sibylline
books, once believed to contain all that was necessary for
the prosperity of the republic, were suspected of an origin
more sinister than celestial; nor were insinuations wanting
that from time to time they had been tampered with to
suit the expediency of passing interests, or even that the
true ones were lost and forgeries put in their stead. The
Greek mythology was to them, as it is to us, an object of
reverence, not because of any inherent truth, but because
of the exquisite embodiments it can yield in poetry, in
painting, in marble. The existence of those illustrious men
who, on account of their useful lives or excellent example,
had, by the pious ages of old, been sanctified or even
deified, was denied, or, if admitted, they were regarded as
the exaggerations of dark and barbarous times. It was
thus with Æsculapius, Bacchus, and Hercules. And as to
the various forms of worship, the multitude of sects into
which the pagan nations were broken up offered themselves
as a spectacle of imbecile and inconsistent devotion altogether
unworthy of attention, except so far as they might
be of use to the interests of the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their irresolution.</div>

<p>Such was the position of things among the educated.
In one sense they had passed into liberty, in another they
were in bondage. Their indisposition to encounter those
inflictions with which their illiterate contemporaries
might visit them may seem to us surprizing:
they acted as if they thought that the public was
a wild beast that would bite if awakened too abruptly
from its dream; but their pusillanimity, at the most,
could only postpone for a little an inevitable day. The
ignorant classes, whom they had so much feared, awoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in due season spontaneously, and saw in the clear light
how matters stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender of affairs in the illiterate classes,</div>

<p>Of the Roman emperors there were some whose intellectual
endowments were of the highest kind; yet, though
it must have been plain to them, as to all who turned
their attention to the matter, in what direction society
was drifting, they let things take their course, and no one
lifted a finger to guide. It may be said that the
genius of Rome manifested itself rather in physical
than in intellectual operations; but in her
best days it was never the genius of Rome to
abandon great events to freedmen, eunuchs, and slaves.
By such it was that the ancient gods were politically cast
aside, while the government was speciously yielding a
simulated obedience to them, and hence it was not at all
surprizing that, soon after the introduction of Christianity,
its pure doctrines were debased by a commingling with
ceremonies of the departing creed. It was not to be
expected that the popular mind could spontaneously
extricate itself from the vicious circle in which it was
involved. Nothing but philosophy was competent to
<span class="sidenote">and consequent debasement of Christianity in Rome.</span>
deliver it, and philosophy failed of its duty at the critical
moment. The classical scholar need scarcely express his
surprize that the Feriæ Augusti were continued
in the Church as the Festival St. Petri in
Vinculis; that even to our own times an image
of the holy Virgin was carried to the river in the
same manner as in the old times was that of Cybele, and
that many pagan rites still continue to be observed in
Rome. Had it been in such incidental particulars only
that the vestiges of paganism were preserved, the thing
would have been of little moment; but, as all who have
examined the subject very well know, the evil was far more
general, far more profound. When it was announced
to the Ephesians that the Council of that place, headed by
Cyril, had decreed that the Virgin should be called "the
Mother of God," with tears of joy they embraced the knees
of their bishop; it was the old instinct peeping out; their
ancestors would have done the same for Diana. If Trajan,
after ten centuries, could have revisited Rome, he would,
without difficulty, have recognized the drama, though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
actors and scenery had all changed; he would have reflected
how great a mistake had been committed in the
legislation of his reign, and how much better it is, when
the intellectual basis of a religion is gone, for a wise
government to abstain from all compulsion in behalf of
what has become untenable, and to throw itself into the
new movement so as to shape the career by assuming the
lead. Philosophy is useless when misapplied in support
of things which common sense has begun to reject; she
shares in the discredit which is attaching to them. The
opportunity of rendering herself of service to humanity
once lost, ages may elapse before it occurs again. Ignorance
and low interests seize the moment, and fasten a
burden on man, which the struggles of a thousand years
may not suffice to cast off. Of all the duties of an
enlightened government, this of allying itself with Philosophy
in the critical moment in which society is passing
through so serious a metamorphosis of its opinions as is
involved in the casting off of its ancient investiture of
Faith, and its assumption of a new one, is the most important,
for it stands connected with things that outlast
all temporal concerns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subject of the
chapter.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the decay of Polytheism and the decline of
philosophy, from the moral and social disorganization
of the Roman empire, I have now
to turn to the most important of all events, the rise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Christianity. I have to show how a variation of opinion
proceeded and reached its culmination; how it was closed
by the establishment of a criterion of truth, under the form
of ecclesiastical councils, and a system developed which
supplied the intellectual wants of Europe for nearly
a thousand years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction to the study of Christianity.</div>

<p>The reader, to whom I have thus offered a representation
of the state of Roman affairs, must now prepare to
look at the consequences thereof. Together we must
trace out the progress of Christianity, examine
the adaptation of its cardinal principles to the
wants of the empire, and the variations it
exhibited&mdash;a task supremely difficult, for even sincerity
and truth will sometimes offend. For my part, it is my
intention to speak with veneration on this great topic, and
yet with liberty, for freedom of thought and expression is
to me the first of all earthly things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distinction between Christianity and ecclesiastical organizations.</div>

<p>But, that I may not be misunderstood, I here, at the
outset, emphatically distinguish between Christianity
and ecclesiastical organizations. The
former is the gift of God; the latter are the
product of human exigencies and human
invention, and therefore open to criticism, or,
if need be, to condemnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Moral state of the world at this period.</div>

<p>From the condition of the Roman empire may be
indicated the principles of any new system adapted to its
amelioration. In the reign of Augustus,
violence paused only because it had finished its
work. Faith was dead; morality had disappeared.
Around the shores of the Mediterranean the
conquered nations looked at one another&mdash;partakers of a
common misfortune, associates in a common lot. Not one
of them had found a god to help her in her day of need.
Europe, Asia, and Africa were tranquil, but it was the
silence of despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unpitying tyranny of Rome.</div>

<p>Rome never considered man as an individual, but only
as a thing. Her way to political greatness was
pursued utterly regardless of human suffering.
If advantages accrued to the conquered under
her dominion, they arose altogether from incident, and
never from her purposed intent. She was no self-conscious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
deliberate civilizer. Conquest and rapine, the uniform
aim of her actions, never permitted her, even at her
utmost intellectual development, to comprehend the equal
rights of all men in the eye of the law. Unpitying in
her stern policy, few were the occasions when, for high
state reasons, she stayed her uplifted hand. She might
in the wantonness of her power, stoop to mercy; she never
rose to benevolence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prepares the way for the recognition of the equality of all men.</div>

<p>When Syria was paying one third of its annual produce
in taxes, is it surprising that the Jewish peasant sighed
for a deliverer, and eagerly listened to the traditions of
his nation that a temporal Messiah, "a king
of the Jews" would soon come? When there
was announced the equality of all men before
God, "who maketh his sun to shine on the
good and the evil, and sendeth his rain on the just and
the unjust," is it surprising that men looked for equal
rights before the law? Universal equality means universal
benevolence; it substitutes for the impersonal and
easily-eluded commands of the state the dictates of an
ever-present conscience; it accepts the injunction, "Do
unto others as you would they should do to you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of Paganism.</div>

<p>In the spread of a doctrine two things are concerned&mdash;its
own intrinsic nature, and the condition of him on
whom it is intended to act. The spread of Christianity is
not difficult to be understood. Its antagonist,
Paganism, presented inherent weakness, infidelity,
and a cheerless prospect; a system, if that can be
called so, which had no ruling idea, no principles, no
organization; caring nothing for proselytes; its rival
pontiffs devoted to many gods, but forming no political
combination; occupying themselves with directing public
worship and foretelling future events, but not interfering
in domestic life; giving itself no concern for the lowly
and unfortunate; not recognizing, or, at the best, doubtfully
admitting a future life; limiting the hopes and
destiny of man to this world; teaching that temporal
prosperity may be selfishly gained at any cost, and looking
to suicide as the relief of the brave from misfortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of Christianity.</div>

<p>On the other side was Christianity, with its enthusiasm
and burning faith; its rewards in this life, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
everlasting happiness or damnation in the next; the
precise doctrines it by degrees gathered of sin, repentance,
pardon; the efficacy of the blood of the Son of
God; its proselytizing spirit; its vivid dogmas
of a resurrection from the dead, the approaching
end of the world, the judgment-day. Above all, in
a worldly point of view, the incomparable organization it
soon attained, and its preaching in season and out of
season. To the needy Christian the charities of the
faithful were freely given; to the desolate, sympathy.
In every congregation there were prayers to God that he
would listen to the sighing of the prisoner and captive,
and have mercy on those who were ready to die. For the
slave and his master there was one law and one hope, one
baptism, one Saviour, one Judge. In times of domestic
bereavement the Christian slave doubtless often consoled
his pagan mistress with the suggestion that our present
separations are only for a little while, and revealed to her
willing ear that there is another world&mdash;a land in which
we rejoin our dead. How is it possible to arrest the
spread of a faith which can make the broken heart leap
with joy?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its first organization.</div>

<p>At its first organization Christianity embodied itself in
a form of communism, the merging of the property of the
disciples into a common stock, from which the necessary
provision for the needy was made. Such a
system, carried out rigorously, is, however,
only suited to small numbers and a brief period. In its
very nature it is impracticable on a great scale.
Scarcely had it been resorted to before such troubles as
that connected with the question of the Hebrew and
Greek widows showed that it must be modified. By this
relief or maintenance out of the funds of the Church, the
spread of the faith among the humbler classes was greatly
facilitated. In warm climates, where the necessities of
life are small, an apparently insignificant sum will
accomplish much in this way. But, as wealth accumulated,
besides this inducement for the poor, there were
temptations for the ambitious: luxurious appointments
and a splendid maintenance, the ecclesiastical dignitaries
becoming more than rivals to those of the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual sectarian divergences.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
From the modification which the primitive organization
thus underwent, we may draw the instructive conclusion
that the special forms of embodiment which the Christian
principle from time to time has assumed, and
of which many might be mentioned, were, in
reality, of only secondary importance. The
sects of the early ages have so totally died away that we
hardly recall the meaning of their names, or determine
their essential dogmas. From fasting, penance, and the
gift of money, things which are of precise measurement,
and therefore well suited to intellectual infancy, there
may be perceived an advancing orthodoxy up to the
highest metaphysical ideas. Yet it must not be supposed
that new observances and doctrines, as they emerged,
were the disconnected inventions of ambitious men. If
rightly considered, they are, in the aggregate, the
product of the uniform progression of human opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early variation of opinions.</div>

<p>Authors who have treated of the sects of earlier times
will point out to the curious reader how, in the beginning,
the Church was agitated by a lingering
attachment to the Hebrew rites, and with
difficulty tore itself away from Judaism, which for the
first ten years was paramount in it; how then, for
several centuries, it became engrossed with disputes
respecting the nature of Christ, and creed after creed
arose therefrom; to the Ebionites he was a mere man;
to the Docetes, a phantasm; to the Jewish Gnostic,
Cerinthus, possessed of a twofold nature; how, after the
spread of Christianity, in succeeding ages, all over the
empire, the intellectual peculiarities of the East and West
<span class="sidenote">Eastern theology tends to Divinity,</span>
were visibly impressed upon it&mdash;the East filled with
speculative doctrines, of which the most important were
those brought forward by the Platonists of
Alexandria, for the Platonists, of all Philosophical
sects, furnished most converts; the West,
in accordance with its utilitarian genius, which esteems
the practical and disparages the intellectual, singularly
aided by propitious opportunity, occupying itself with
material aggrandizement and territorial power. The
vanishing point of all Christian sectarian ideas of the
East was in God, of those of the West in Man. Herein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
consists the essential difference between them. The one
was rich in doctrines respecting the nature of
<span class="sidenote">Western to Humanity.</span>
the Divinity, the other abounded in regulations
for the improvement and consolation of humanity. For
long there was a tolerance, and even liberality toward
differences of opinion. Until the Council of Nicea, no one
was accounted a heretic if only he professed his belief in
the Apostles' Creed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign modifications of Christianity.</div>

<p>A very astute ecclesiastical historian, referring to the
early contaminations of Christianity, makes
this remark: "A clear and unpolluted fountain
fed by secret channels with the dew of Heaven,
when it grows a large river, and takes a long and winding
course, receives a tincture from the various soils through
which it passes."</p>

<p>Thus influenced by circumstances, the primitive
modifications of Christianity were three&mdash;Judaic Christianity,
Gnostic Christianity, African Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judaic Christianity.</div>

<p>Of these, the first consisted of contaminations from
Judaism, from which true Christianity disentangled
itself with extreme difficulty, at the
cost of dissensions among the Apostles themselves.
From the purely Hebrew point of view of the early
disciples, who surrendered with reluctance their expectation
that the Saviour was the long-looked-for temporal
Messiah, the King of the Jews, under which name he
suffered, the faith gradually expanded, including successively
proselytes of the Gate, the surrounding Gentiles,
and at last the whole world, irrespective of nation, climate,
or colour. With this truly imperial extension, there came
into view the essential doctrines on which it was based.
But Judaic Christianity, properly speaking, soon came to an
untimely end. It was unable to maintain itself against
the powerful apostolic influences in the bosom of the
Church, and the violent pressure exerted by the unbelieving
Jews, who exhibited toward it an inflexible hatred.
Moreover, the rapid advance of the new doctrines through
Asia Minor and Greece offered a tempting field for
enthusiasm. The first preachers in the Roman empire were
Jews; for the first years circumcision and conformity to
the law of Moses were insisted on; but the first council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
determined that point, at Jerusalem, probably about <small>A.D.</small>
49, in the negative. The organization of the Church,
originally modelled upon that of the Synagogue, was
changed. In the beginning the creed and the rites were
simple; it was only necessary to profess belief in the Lord
Jesus Christ, and baptism marked the admission of the
convert into the community of the faithful. James, the
brother of our Lord, as might, from his relationship,
be expected, occupied the position of headship in
the Church. The names of the bishops of the church of
Jerusalem, as given by Eusebius, succeed to James, the
brother of Christ, in the following order: Simeon, Justus,
Zaccheus, Tobias, Benjamin, John, Matthew, Philip,
Simeon, Justus, Levi, Ephraim, Joseph, and Judas. The
names are indicative of the nationality. It was the
boast of this Church that it was not corrupted with any
heresy until the last Jewish bishop, a boast which must
be received with some limitation, for very early we find
traces of two distinct parties in Jerusalem&mdash;those who
received the account of the miraculous conception and
those who did not. The Ebionites, who were desirous of
tracing our Saviour's lineage up to David, did so according
to the genealogy given in the Gospel of St. Mathew,
and therefore they would not accept what was said
respecting the miraculous conception, affirming that it
was apocryphal, and in obvious contradiction to the
genealogy in which our Saviour's line was traced up
through Joseph, who, it would thus appear, was not his
father. They are to be considered as the national or
patriotic party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the arrest of Jewish conversion.</div>

<p>Two causes seem to have been concerned in arresting the
spread of conversion among the Jews: the first
was their disappointment as respects the temporal
power of the Messiah; the second, the
prominence eventually given to the doctrine of the Trinity.
Their jealousy of anything that might touch the national
doctrine of the unity of God became almost a fanaticism.
Judaic Christianity may be said to have virtually ended
with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans; its
last trace, however, was the dispute respecting Easter,
which was terminated by the Council of Nicea. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
conversion of the Jews had ceased before the reign of
Constantine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gnostic Christianity.</div>

<p>The second form, Gnostic Christianity, had reached its
full development within a century after the death of
Christ; it maintained an active influence through the first
four centuries, and gave birth, during that time,
to many different subordinate sects. It consisted
essentially in ingrafting Christianity upon Magianism.
It made the Saviour an emanated intelligence, derived
from the eternal, self-existing mind; this intelligence, and
not the Man-Jesus, was the Christ, who thus, being an
impassive phantom, afforded to Gnosticism no idea of an
expiatory sacrifice, none of an atonement. It was arrested
by the reappearance of pure Magianism in the Persian
empire under Ardeschir Babhegan; not, however, without
communicating to orthodox Christianity an impression far
more profound than is commonly supposed, and one of
which indelible traces may be perceived in our day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Platonic Christianity.</div>

<p>The third form, African or Platonic Christianity, arose
in Alexandria. Here was the focus of those fatal
disputes respecting the Trinity, a word which
does not occur in the Holy Scriptures, and which, it
appears, had been first introduced by Theophilus, the
Bishop of Antioch, the seventh from the apostles. In
the time of Hadrian, Christianity had become diffused all
over Egypt, and had found among the Platonizing philosophers
of the metropolis many converts. These men
modified the Gnostic idea to suit their own doctrines,
asserting that the principle from which the universe originated
was something emitted from the Supreme Mind,
and capable of being drawn into it again, as they supposed
was the case with a ray and the sun. This ray, they
affirmed, was permanently attached to our Saviour, and
hence he might be considered as God. Thus, therefore,
there were in his person three parts, a body, a soul, and
the logos; hence he was both God and man. But, as a
ray is inferior to the sun, it seemed to follow that the
Christ must be inferior to the Father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Logos.</div>

<p>In all this it is evident that there is something transcendental,
and the Platonizing Christians, following the
habit of the Greek philosophers, considered it as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
mysterious doctrine; they spoke of it as "meat for strong
men," but the popular current doctrine was "milk for
babes." Justin Martyr, <small>A.D.</small> 132, who had been a Platonic
philosopher, believed that the divine ray, after it was
attached to Christ, was never withdrawn from
him, and never separated from its source. He
offers two illustrations of his idea. As speech (logos), going
forth from one man, enters into another, conveying to him
meaning, while the same meaning remains in the person
who speaks, thus the logos of the Father continues unimpaired
in himself, though imparted to the Christ; or, as
from one lamp another may be lighted without any loss of
splendour, so the divinity of the Father is transferred to
the Son. This last illustration subsequently became very
popular, and was adopted into the Nicene Creed. "God
of God, Light of Light."</p>

<p>It is obvious that the intention of this reasoning was to
preserve intact, the doctrine of the unity of God, for the
great body of Christians were at this time monarchists, the
word being used in its theological acceptation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permanence of Alexandrian ideas.</div>

<p>Thus the Jewish and Gnostic forms both died out, but
the African, Platonic, or Alexandrian, was destined
to be perpetuated. The manner in which
this occurred, can only be understood by a study
of the political history of the times. To such facts as are
needful for the purpose, I shall therefore with brevity allude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of Christianity from Syria.</div>

<p>From its birthplace in Judea, Christianity advanced to
the conquest of the Roman world. In its primitive form
it received an urgency from the belief that the
end of all things was close at hand, and that
the earth was on the point of being burnt up
by fire. From the civil war it waged in Judea, it emerged
to enter on a war of invasion and foreign annexation. In
succession, Cyprus, Phrygia, Galatia, and all Asia Minor,
Greece, and Italy, were penetrated. The persecutions of
Nero, incident on the burning of Rome, did not for a
moment retard its career; during his reign it rapidly
spread, and in every direction Petrine and Pauline, or
Judaizing and Hellenizing churches were springing up.
The latter gained the superiority, and the former passed
away. The constitution of the churches changed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
congregations gradually losing power, which became concentrated
in the bishop. By the end of the first
<span class="sidenote">Modifications of organization become necessary.</span>
century the episcopal form was predominant, and
the ecclesiastical organization so imposing as to
command the attention of the emperors, who now
began to discover the mistake that had hitherto been made
in confounding the new religion with Judaism. Their dislike
to it, soon manifested in measures of repression, was
in consequence of the peculiar attitude it assumed. As a
body, the Christians not only kept aloof from all the
amusements of the times, avoiding theatres and public
rejoicings, but in every respect constituted themselves an
<span class="sidenote">Becomes antagonistic to Imperialism.</span>
empire within the empire. Such a state of things was
altogether inconsistent with the established
government, and its certain inconveniences and
evils were not long in making themselves felt.
The triumphant march of Christianity was singularly
facilitated by free intercommunication over the
Mediterranean, in consequence of that sea being in the
hands of one sovereign power. The Jewish and Greek
merchants afforded it a medium; their trading towns
were its posts. But it is not to be supposed that its spread
was without resistance; for at least the first century and a
half the small farmers and land labourers entertained a
<span class="sidenote">Persecution consolidates it.</span>
hatred to it, looking upon it as a peculiarity of the trading
communities, whom they ever despised. They persuaded
themselves that the earthquakes, inundations
and pestilences were attributable to it. To these
incitements was added a desire to seize the property of
the faithful confiscated by the law. Of this the early
Christians unceasingly and bitterly complained. But the
rack, the fire, wild beasts were unavailingly applied. Out
of the very persecutions themselves advantages arose.
Injustice and barbarity bound the pious but feeble communities
together, and repressed internal dissent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defiant air of the young churches.</div>

<p>In several instances, however, there can be no doubt
that persecution was brought on by the defiant
air the churches assumed as they gathered
strength. To understand this, we have only to
peruse such documents as the address of Tertullian to
Scapula. Full of intolerant spirit, it accuses the national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
religion of being the cause of all the public calamities, the
floods, the fires, the eclipses; it denounces the vengeance
of God on the national idolatry. As was the opinion of
the Christians at that time, it acknowledges the reality of
the pagan gods, whom it stigmatizes as demons, and proclaims
its determination to expel them. It warns its
opponents that they may be stricken blind, devoured by
<span class="sidenote">Opposition of the emperors.</span>
worms, or visited with other awful calamities. Such a
sentiment of scorn and hatred, gathering force enough to
make itself politically felt, was certain to
provoke persecution. That of Decius, <small>A.D.</small> 250,
was chiefly aimed against the clergy, not even the bishops
of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome escaping. Eight years
afterwards occurred that in which Sextus, the Bishop of
Rome, and Cyprian of Carthage perished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of things under Diocletian.</div>

<p>Under Diocletian it had become apparent that the self-governed
Christian corporations everywhere
arising were altogether incompatible with the
imperial system. If tolerated much longer,
they would undoubtedly gain such strength as to become
politically quite formidable. There was not a town, hardly
a village in the empire&mdash;nay, what was indeed far more
serious, there was not a legion in which these organizations
did not exist. The uncompromising and inexorable spirit
animating them brought on necessarily a triple alliance
of the statesmen, the philosophers, and the polytheists.
These three parties, composing or postponing their mutual
disputes, cordially united to put down the common enemy
before it should be too late. It so fell out that the conflict
first broke out in the army. When the engine of power
is affected, it behoves a prince to take heed. The Christian
soldiers in some of the legions refused to join in the
time-honoured solemnities for propitiating the gods. It
was in the winter <small>A.D.</small> 302-3. The emergency became so
pressing that a council was held by Diocletian and Galerius
to determine what should be done. The difficulty of the
position may perhaps be appreciated when it is understood
that even the wife and daughter of Diocletian himself were
adherents of the new religion. He was a man of such
capacity and enlarged political views that, at the second
council of the leading statesmen and generals, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
not have been brought to give his consent to repression if
<span class="sidenote">Imperial persecutions.</span>
it had not been quite clear that a conflict was unavoidable.
His extreme reluctance to act is shown by the express
stipulation he made that there should be no
sacrifice of life. It is scarcely necessary to
relate the events which ensued; how the Church of
Nicomedia was razed to the ground; how, in retaliation,
the imperial palace was set on fire; how an edict was
openly insulted and torn down; how the Christian officers
in the army were compelled to resign; and, as Eusebius,
an eye-witness, relates, a vast number of martyrs soon
suffered in Armenia, Syria, Mauritania, Egypt, and elsewhere.
So resistless was the march of events that not
even the emperor himself could stop the persecution. The
Christians were given over to torture, the fire, wild beasts,
beheading; many of them, in the moment of condemnation,
simply returning thanks to God that he had thought them
worthy to suffer. The whole world was filled with admiration.
The greatness of such holy courage could have
<span class="sidenote">Their great political consequences.</span>
no other result. An internecine conflict between the disputants
seemed to be inevitable. But, in the dark and
bloody policy of the times, the question was settled in an
unexpected way. To Constantine, who had fled from
the treacherous custody of Galerius, it naturally occurred
that if he should ally himself to the Christian party, conspicuous
advantages must forthwith accrue to
him. It would give him in every corner of the
empire men and women ready to encounter fire
and sword; it would give him partisans, not only animated
by the traditions of their fathers, but&mdash;for human nature
will even in the religious assert itself&mdash;demanding retribution
for the horrible barbarities and injustice that had
been inflicted on themselves; it would give him, and this
was the most important of all, unwavering adherents in
<span class="sidenote">Successful policy of Constantine.</span>
every legion of the army. He took his course. The events
of war crowned him with success. He could
not be otherwise than outwardly true to those
who had given him power, and who continued
to maintain him on the throne. But he never conformed
to the ceremonial requirements of the Church till the close
of his evil life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
The attempt to make an alliance with this great and
rapidly growing party was nothing new. Maximin tried
it, but was distrusted. Licinius, foreseeing the policy
that Constantine would certainly pursue, endeavoured to
neutralize it by feebly reviving the persecution, <small>A.D.</small> 316,
thinking thereby to conciliate the pagans. The aspirants
for empire at this moment so divided the strength of the
state that, had the Christian party been weaker than it
actually was, it so held the balance of power as to be able
to give a preponderance to the candidate of its choice.
Much more, therefore, was it certain to prevail, considering
its numbers, its ramifications, its compactness. Force,
argument, and persuasion had alike proved ineffectual
against its strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the reign of Constantine.</div>

<p>To the reign of Constantine the Great must be referred
the commencement of those dark and dismal
times which oppressed Europe for a thousand
years. It is the true close of the Roman empire,
the beginning of the Greek. The transition from one to
the other is emphatically and abruptly marked by a new
metropolis, a new religion, a new code, and, above all, a
new policy. An ambitious man had attained to imperial
power by personating the interests of a rapidly growing
party. The unavoidable consequences were a union between
the Church and State; a diverting of the dangerous classes
from civil to ecclesiastical paths, and the decay and
materialization of religion. This, and not the reign of
Leo the Isaurian, as some have said, is the true beginning
of the Byzantine empire; it is also the beginning of the
age of Faith in Europe, though I consider the age of
Inquiry as overlapping this epoch, and as terminating
with the military fall of Rome.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical authors have made everything hinge on
the conversion of Constantine and the national establishment
of Christianity. The medium through which they
look distorts the position of objects, and magnifies the
subordinate and the collateral into the chief. Events had
been gradually shaping themselves in such a way that the
political fall of the city of Rome was inevitable. The
Romans, as a people, had disappeared, being absorbed
among other nations; the centre of power was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
army. One after another, the legions put forth competitors
for the purple&mdash;soldiers of fortune, whose success could
never remove low habits due to a base origin, the coarseness
of a life of camps&mdash;who found no congeniality in the
elegance and refinement of those relics of the ancient
families which were expiring in Rome. They despised
the military decrepitude of the superannuated city; her
recollections they hated. To such men the expediency of
founding a new capital was an obvious device; or, if
indisposed to undertake so laborious a task, the removal
of the imperial residence to some other of the great towns
was an effectual substitute. It was thus that the residence
of Diocletian at Nicomedia produced such disastrous consequences
in a short time to Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He resolves on removing the metropolis.</div>

<p>After Constantine had murdered his son Crispus, his
nephew Licinius, and had suffocated in a steam-bath his
wife Fausta, to whom he had been married twenty years,
and who was the mother of three of his sons, the
public abhorrence of his crimes could no longer
be concealed. A pasquinade, comparing his
reign to that of Nero, was affixed to the palace gate. The
guilty emperor, in the first burst of anger, was on the
point of darkening the tragedy, if such a thing had been
possible, by a massacre of the Roman populace who had
thus insulted him. It is said that his brothers were consulted
on this measure of vengeance. The result of their
counsel was even more deadly, for it was resolved to
degrade Rome to a subordinate rank, and build a metropolis
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is a protector, but not a convert.</div>

<p>Political conditions thus at once suggested and rendered
possible the translation of the seat of government: the
temporary motive was the vengeance of a great criminal.
Perhaps, also, in the mental occupation incident to such
an undertaking, the emperor found a refuge from the
accusations of conscience. But it is altogether erroneous
to suppose that either at this time, or for many years subsequently,
he was a Christian. His actions are
not those of a devout convert; he was no proselyte,
but a protector; never guiding himself by
religious principles, but now giving the most valuable
support to his new allies, now exhibiting the impartiality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of a statesman for both forms of faith. In his character
of Pontifex Maximus he restored pagan temples, and
directed that the haruspices should be consulted. On the
festival of the birthday of the new city he honoured the
statue of Fortune. The continued heathen sacrifices and
open temples seemed to indicate that he intended to do
no more than place the new religion on a level with the
old. His recommendation to the Bishop of Alexandria
and to Arius of the example of the philosophers, who never
debated profound questions before ignorant audiences, and
who could differ without hating one another, illustrates
the indifferentism of his personal attitude, and yet he
clearly recognized his obligations to the party that had
given him power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His tendencies to Paganism.</div>

<p>This conclusion is confirmed by the works of Constantine
himself. They must be regarded as far better authority
than the writings of religious polemics. A medal was
struck, on which was impressed his title of
"God," together with the monogram of Christ.
Another represented him as raised by a hand from the
sky while seated in the chariot of the Sun. But more
particularly the great porphyry pillar, a column 120 feet
in height, exhibited the true religious condition of the
founder of Constantinople. The statue on its summit
mingled together the Sun, the Saviour, and the Emperor.
Its body was a colossal image of Apollo, whose features
were replaced by those of Constantine, and round the head,
like rays, were fixed the nails of the cross of Christ recently
discovered in Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His relations to the Church.</div>

<p>The position of a patron assumed by Constantine may
be remarked in many of the incidents of his policy. The
edict of Milan gave liberty both to Pagans and Christians;
but his necessity for showing in some degree a preponderance
of favour for the latter obliged him to issue a rescript
exempting the clergy from civil offices. It was this also
which led him to conciliate the bishops by the donation of
large sums of money for the restoration of their churches
and other purposes, and to exert himself, often by objectionable
means, for destroying that which they who were
around him considered to be heresy. A better motive,
perhaps, led him to restore those Christians who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
degraded; to surrender to the legal heirs the confiscated
estates of martyrs, or, if no heirs were to be found, to convey
them to the Church; to set at liberty those who had
been condemned to the mines; to recall those who had
been banished. If, as a tribute to the Christians, who had
sustained him politically, he made the imperial treasury
responsible for many of their losses; if he caused costly
churches to be built not only in the great cities, but even
in the Holy Land; if he vindicated the triumphant position
of his supporters by forbidding any Jew to have a
Christian slave; if he undertook to enforce the decisions
of councils by means of the power of the state; if he forbade
all schism in the Church, himself determining the
degrees of heresy under the inspirations of his ecclesiastical
entourage, his vacillations show how little he
was guided by principle, how much by policy.
After the case of the Donatists had been settled by repeated
councils, he spontaneously recalled them from banishment;
after he had denounced Arius as "the very image of the
Devil," he, through the influence of court females, received
him again into favour; after the temple of Æsculapius at
Ægæ had been demolished, and the doors and roofs of
others removed, the pagans were half conciliated by perceiving
that no steady care was taken to enforce the
obnoxious decrees, and that, after all, the Christians would
have to accept the declarations of the emperor for deeds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequences of building a new metropolis.</div>

<p>In a double respect the removal of the seat of empire
was important to Christianity. It rendered possible the
assumption of power by the bishops of Rome,
who were thereby secluded from imperial observation
and inspection, and whose position, feeble
at first, under such singularly auspicious circumstances
was at last developed into papal supremacy. In
Constantinople, also, there were no pagan recollections and
interests to contend with. At first the new city was essentially
Roman, and its language Latin; but this was soon
changed for Greek, and thus the transference of the seat
of government tended in the end to make Latin a sacred
tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The policy of Constantine.</div>

<p>Constantine knew very well where Roman power had
for many years lain. His own history, from the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
his father's death and his exaltation by the legions at York,
had taught him that, for the perpetuation of his dynasty
and system, those formidable bodies must be disposed of.
It was for this reason, and that no future commander
might do what himself and so many of
his predecessors had done, that he reduced the strength of
the legion from 6000 to 1500 or 1000 men. For this
reason, too, he opened to ambition the less dangerous field
of ecclesiastical wealth and dignity, justly concluding that,
since the clergy came from every class of society, the
whole people would look to the prosperity of the Church.
By exempting the priesthood from burdensome municipal
offices, such as the decurionate, he put a premium on
apostacy from paganism. The interest he personally took
in the Trinitarian controversy encouraged the spreading
of theological disputation from philosophers and men of
capacity to the populace. Under the old polytheism heresy
was impossible, since every man might select his god and
his worship; but under the new monotheism it was inevitable&mdash;heresy,
a word that provokes and justifies a black
catalogue of crimes. Occupied in those exciting pursuits,
men took but little heed of the more important political
changes that were in progress. The eyes of the rabble
were easily turned from the movements of the government
by horse-racing, theatres, largesses. Yet already this diversion
of ambition into new fields gave tokens of dangers
to the state in future times. The Donatists, whom Constantine
had attempted to pacify by the Councils of Rome,
Arles, and Milan, maintained a more than religious revolt,
and exhibited the bitterness that may be infused among
competitors for ecclesiastical spoils. These enthusiasts
assumed to themselves the title of God's elect, proclaimed
that the only true apostolic succession was in their bishops,
and that whosoever denied the right of Donatus to be
Bishop of Carthage should be eternally damned. They
asked, with a truth that lent force to their demand,
"What has the emperor to do with the Church, what have
Christians to do with kings, what have bishops to do at
court?" Already the Catholic party, in preparation of its
commencing atrocities, ominously inquired, "Is the vengeance
of God to be defrauded of its victims?" Already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Constantine, by bestowing on the Church the right of
receiving bequests, had given birth to that power which,
reposing on the influence that always attaches to the
possession of land, becomes at last overwhelming when it
is held by a corporation which may always receive and can
never alienate, which is always renewing itself and can
never die. It was by no miraculous agency, but simply
by its organization, that the Church attained to power;
an individual who must die, and a family which must
become extinct, had no chance against a corporation whose
purposes were ever unchanged, and its life perpetual. But
it was not the state alone which thus took detriment from
her connection with the Church; the latter paid a full
price for the temporal advantages she received in admitting
civil intervention in her affairs. After a retrospect of a
thousand years, the pious Fratricelli loudly proclaimed
their conviction that the fatal gift of a Christian emperor
had been the doom of true religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His conversion and death.</div>

<p>From the rough soldier who accepted the purple at
York, how great the change to the effeminate emperor of
the Bosphorus, in silken robes stiffened with threads of
gold, a diadem of sapphires and pearls, and false hair
stained of various tints; his steps stealthily guarded by
mysterious eunuchs flitting through the palace, the streets
full of spies, and an ever-watchful police! The same man
who approaches us as the Roman imperator retires from
us as the Asiatic despot. In the last days of his
life, he put aside the imperial purple, and,
assuming the customary white garment, prepared for
baptism, that the sins of his long and evil life might all
be washed away. Since complete purification can thus be
only once obtained, he was desirous to procrastinate that
ceremony to the last moment. Profoundly politic, even in
his relations with heaven, he thenceforth reclined on a
white bed, took no further part in worldly affairs, and,
having thus insured a right to the continuance of that
prosperity in a future life which he had enjoyed in this,
expired, <small>A.D.</small> 337.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Trinitarian controversy.</div>

<p>In a theological respect, among the chief events of
this emperor's reign are the Trinitarian controversy and
the open materialization of Christianity. The former,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
commencing among the Platonizing ecclesiastics of Alexandria,
continued for ages to exert a formidable
influence. From time immemorial, as we have
already related, the Egyptians had been familiar
with various trinities, different ones being worshipped in
different cities, the devotees of each exercising a peaceful
toleration toward those of others. But now things were
greatly changed. It was the settled policy of Constantine
to divert ambition from the state to the Church, and to
make it not only safer, but more profitable to be a great
ecclesiastic than a successful soldier. A violent competition,
for the chief offices was the consequence&mdash;a
competition, the prelude of that still greater one for
episcopal supremacy.</p>

<p>We are now again brought to a consideration of the
variations of opinion which marked this age. It would
be impossible to give a description of them all. I therefore
propose to speak only of the prominent ones. They
are a sufficient guide in our investigation; and of the
Trinitarian controversy first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prelude of sectarian dissent.</div>

<p>For some time past dissensions had been springing up
in the Church. Even out of persecution itself
disunion had arisen. The martyrs who had
suffered for their faith, and the confessors who had nobly
avowed it, gained a worthy consideration and influence,
becoming the intermedium of reconciliation of such of
their weaker brethren as had apostatized in times of peril
by authoritative recommendations to "the peace of the
Church." From this abuses arose. Martyrs were known
to have given the use of their names to "a man and his
friends;" nay, it was even asserted that tickets of
recommendation had been bought for money; and as it
was desirable that a uniformity of discipline should obtain
in all the churches, so that he who was excommunicated
from one should be excommunicated from all, it was
necessary that these abuses should be corrected. In the
controversies that ensued, Novatus founded his sect on
the principle that penitent apostates should, under no
circumstances, be ever again received. Besides this
dissent on a question of discipline, already there were
abundant elements of dispute, such as the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
observance of Easter, the nature of Christ, the millennium
upon earth, and rebaptism. Already, in Syria, Noetus,
the Unitarian, had foreshadowed what was coming;
already there were Patripassians; already Sabellianism
existed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arius, his doctrines.</div>

<p>But it was in Alexandria that the tempest burst forth.
There lived in that city a presbyter of the
name of Arius, who, on occasion of a vacancy
occurring, desired to be appointed bishop. But one Alexander
supplanted him in the coveted dignity. Both
relied on numerous supporters, Arius counting among his
not less than seven hundred virgins of the Mareotic nome.
In his disappointment he accused his successful antagonist
of Sabellianism, and, in retaliation, was anathematized.
It was no wonder that, in such an atmosphere, the
question quickly assumed a philosophical aspect. The
point of difficulty was to define the position of the Son in
the Holy Trinity. Arius took the ground that there was
a time when, from the very nature of sonship, the Son did
not exist, and a time at which he commenced to be,
asserting that it is the necessary condition of the filial
relation that a father must be older than his son. But
this assertion evidently might imply subordination or
inequality among the three persons of the Holy Trinity.
The partisans of Alexander raised up their voices against
such a blasphemous lowering of the Redeemer; the Arians
answered them that, by exalting the Son in every respect
to an equality with the Father, they impugned the great
truth of the unity of God. The new bishop himself
edified the giddy citizens, and perhaps, in some degree,
justified his appointment to his place by displaying his
rhetorical powers in public debates on the question. The
Alexandrians, little anticipating the serious and enduring
results soon to arise, amused themselves, with characteristic
levity, by theatrical representations of the contest
upon the stage. The passions of the two parties were
roused; the Jews and Pagans, of whom the town was full,
exasperated things by their mocking derision. The
dissension spread: the whole country became convulsed.
In the hot climate of Africa, theological controversy soon
ripened into political disturbance. In all Egypt there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Constantine attempts to check the controversy,</span>
was not a Christian man, and not a woman, who did not
proceed to settle the nature of the unity of God. The
tumult rose to such a pitch that it became
necessary for the emperor to interfere. Doubtless,
at first, he congratulated himself on such a
course of events. It was better that the provinces
should be fanatically engaged in disputes than
secretly employed in treason against his person or conspiracies
against his policy. A united people is an
inconvenience to one in power. Nevertheless, to compose
the matter somewhat, he sent Hosius, the Bishop of
<span class="sidenote">and summons the Council of Nicea.</span>
Cordova, to Alexandria; but, finding that the remedy was
altogether inadequate, he was driven at last to
the memorable expedient of summoning the
Council of Nicea, <small>A.D.</small> 325. It attempted a
settlement of the trouble by a condemnation of Arius, and
the promulgation of authoritative articles of belief as set
forth in the Nicene Creed. As to the main point, the Son
was declared to be of the same substance with the Father&mdash;a
temporizing and convenient, but, as the event proved,
a disastrous ambiguity. The Nicene Council, therefore,
settled the question by evading it, and the emperor
enforced the decision by the banishment of Arius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fortunesof Arius.</div>

<p>"I am persecuted," Arius plaintively said, "because I
have taught that the Son had a beginning and the Father
had not." It was the influence of the court theologians
that had made the emperor his personal enemy.
Constantine, as we have seen, had looked upon
the dispute, in the first instance, as altogether frivolous, if
he did not, in truth, himself incline to the assertion of
Arius, that, in the very nature of the thing, a father must
be older than his son. The theatrical exhibitions at
Alexandria in mockery of the question were calculated to
confirm him in his opinion: his judgment was lost in the
theories that were springing up as to the nature of Christ;
for on the Ebionitish, Gnostic, and Platonic doctrines, as
well as on the new one that "the logos" was made out of
nothing, it equally followed that the current opinion must
be erroneous, and that there was a time before which the
Son did not exist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His condemnation as a heretic.</div>

<p>But, as the contest spread through churches and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
families, Constantine had found himself compelled to
intervene. At first he attempted the position of a
moderator, but soon took ground against Arius, advised to
that course by his entourage at Constantinople. It was
at this time that the letter was circulated in which he
denounced Arius as the image of the Devil.
Arius might now have foreseen what must
certainly occur at Nicea. Before that council
was called everything was settled. No contemporary for
a moment supposed that this was an assembly of simple-hearted
men, anxious by a mutual comparison of thought,
to ascertain the truth. Its aim was not to compose such a
creed as would give unity to the Church, but one so
worded that the Arians would be compelled to refuse to
sign it, and so ruin themselves. To the creed was
attached an anathema precisely defining the point of
dispute, and leaving the foreordained victims no chance of
escape. The original Nicene Creed differed in some
<span class="sidenote">The Nicene Creed.</span>
essential particulars from that now current under that
title. Among other things, the fatal and final clause has
been dropped. Thus it ran: "The Holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes
those who say that there was a time when the Son of God
was not; and that before he was begotten he was not, and
that he was made out of nothing, or out of another
substance or essence, and is created, or changeable, or
alterable." The emperor enforced the decision of the
council by the civil power; he circulated letters denouncing
Arius, and initiated those fearful punishments
unhappily destined in future ages to become so frequent,
by ordaining that whoever should find one of the books of
Arius and not burn it should actually be put to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arius received again into court favour,</div>

<p>It might be thought that, after such a decisive course,
it would be impossible to change, and yet in less than ten
years Constantine is found agreeing with the convict
Arius. A presbyter in the confidence of Constantia, the
emperor's sister, had wrought upon him. Athanasius, now
Bishop of Alexandria, the representative of the
other party, is deposed and banished. Arius is
invited to Constantinople. The emperor orders
Alexander, the bishop of that city, to receive him into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
communion to-morrow. It is Saturday. Alexander flees
to the church, and, falling prostrate, prays to God that
he will interpose and save his servant from being forced
<span class="sidenote">and is poisoned.</span>
into this sin, even if it should be by death. That same
evening Arius was seized with a sudden and violent illness
as he passed along the street, and in a few moments he
was found dead in a house, whither he had
hastened. In Constantinople, where men were
familiar with Asiatic crimes, there was more than a
suspicion of poison. But when Alexander's party proclaimed
that his prayer had been answered, they forgot
what then that prayer must have been, and that the
difference is little between praying for the death of a man
and compassing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantine prepares for a new creed.</div>

<p>The Arians affirmed that it was the intention of Constantine
to have called a new council, and have the creed
rectified according to his more recent ideas;
but, before he could accomplish this, he was
overtaken by death. So little efficacy was there
in the determination of the Council of Nicea, that for
many years afterward creed upon creed appeared. What
Constantine's new creed would have been may be told
from the fact that the Consubstantialists had gone out of
power, and from what his son Constantius soon after did
at the Council of Ariminium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of theological disputes.</div>

<p>So far, therefore, from the Council of Nicea ending the
controversies afflicting religion, they continued
with increasing fury. The sons and successors
of Constantine set an example of violence in
these disputes; and, until the barbarians burst in upon
the empire, the fourth century wore away in theological
feuds. Even the populace, scarcely emerged from paganism,
set itself up for a judge on questions from their very nature
incapable of being solved; and to this the government
gave an impetus by making the profits of public service
the reward of sectarian violence. The policy of Constantine
began to produce its results. Mental activity and
ambition found their true field in ecclesiastical affairs.
Orthodoxy triumphed, because it was more in unison with
the present necessity of the court, while asserting the
predominance of Christianity, to offend as little as might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
be the pagan party. The heresy of Arius, though it might
suit the monotheistic views of the educated, did not commend
itself to that large mass who had been so recently
pagan. Already the elements of dissension were obvious
enough; on one side there was an illiterate, intolerant,
unscrupulous, credulous, numerous body, on the other a
refined, better-informed, yet doubting sect. The Emperor
Constantius, guided by his father's latest principles, having
sided with the Arian party, soon found that under the
<span class="sidenote">Athanasius rebels against the emperor.</span>
new system a bishop would, without hesitation, oppose his
sovereign. Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria, as the
head of the orthodox party, became the personal
antagonist of the emperor, who attempted, after
vainly using physical compulsion, to resort to
the celestial weapons in vogue by laying claim to Divine
inspiration. Like his father, he had a celestial vision;
but, as his views were Arian, the orthodox rejected without
scruple his supernatural authority, and Hilary of Poictiers
wrote a book to prove that he was Antichrist. The horrible
bloodshed and murders attending these quarrels in the
great cities, and the private life of persons both of high
and low degree, clearly showed that Christianity, through
its union with politics, had fallen into such a state that
it could no longer control the passions of men. The
biography of the sons of Constantine is an awful relation
of family murders. Religion had disappeared, theology
<span class="sidenote">Steady aggression of the Church and crimes
of ecclesiastics.</span>
had come in its stead. Even theology had gone mad. But
in the midst of these disputes worldly interests
were steadily kept in view. At the Council of
Ariminium, <small>A.D.</small> 359, an attempt was made to
have the lands belonging to the churches exempt
from all taxation; to his credit, the emperor steadfastly
refused. Macedonius, the Bishop of Constantinople, who
had passed over the slaughtered bodies of three thousand
people to take possession of his episcopal throne, exceeded
in heresy even Arius himself, by not only asserting the
inferiority of the Son to the Father, but by absolutely
denying the divinity of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two results of these events.</div>

<p>As the fruits of these broils, two facts appear: 1st, that
there is a higher law, which the faithful may
obey, in opposition to the law of the land, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
it suits their views; the law of God, as expounded by the
bishop, who can eternally punish the soul, must take
precedence of the law of Cæsar, who can only kill the body
and seize the goods; 2d, that there is a supremacy in the
Bishop of Rome, to whom Athanasius, the leader of the
orthodox, by twice visiting that city, submitted his cause.
The significance of these facts becomes conspicuous in later
ages. Things were evidently shaping themselves for a
trial of strength between the imperial and ecclesiastical
powers, heretofore allied. They were about to quarrel
over their booty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">History of Papal supremacy.</div>

<p>We have now to consider this asserted supremacy of the
Bishop of Rome, and how it came to be established as a
political fact. We must also turn from the
Oriental variations of opinion to those of the
West. Except by thus enlarging the field to be
traversed, we can gain no perfect conception of the general
intellectual tendency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hellenized Christianity.</div>

<p>For long after its introduction to Western Europe,
Christianity was essentially a Greek religion.
Its Oriental aspect had become Hellenized. Its
churches had, in the first instance, a Greek organization,
conducted their worship in that tongue, and composed
their writings in it. Though it retained much of this
foreign aspect so long as Rome continued to be the residence,
or was more particularly under the eye of the
emperors, it was gradually being affected by the influences
to which it was exposed. On Western Europe, the questions
which had so profoundly agitated the East, such as
the nature of God, the Trinity, the cause of evil, had made
but little impression, the intellectual peculiarity of the
people being unsuited to such exercises. The foundation
of Constantinople, by taking off the political pressure,
permitted native peculiarities to manifest themselves, and
Latin Christianity emerged in contradistinction to Greek.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modified by Africanism.</div>

<p>Yet still it cannot be said that Europe owes its existing
forms of Christianity to a Roman origin. It is
indebted to Africa for them. We live under
African domination.</p>

<p>I have now with brevity to relate the progress of this
interesting event; how African conceptions were firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
established in Rome, and, by the time that Greek Christianity
had lost its expansive power and ceased to be
aggressive, African Christianity took its place, extending
to the North and West, and obtaining for itself an organization
copied from that of the Roman empire; sacerdotal
prætors, proconsuls, and a Cæsar; developing its own
jurisprudence, establishing its own magistracy, exchanging
the Greek tongue it had hitherto used for the Latin, which,
soon becoming a sacred language, conferred upon it the
most singular advantages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subordinate position of the early Roman Church.</div>

<p>The Greek churches were of the nature of confederated
republics; the Latin Church instinctively tended to
monarchy. Far from assuming an attitude of conspicuous
dignity, the primitive bishops of Rome led a life of
obscurity. In the earliest times, the bishops of Jerusalem,
of whom James, the brother of our Lord, was the first, are
spoken of as the heads of the Church, and so regarded even
in Rome itself. The controversy respecting
Easter, <small>A.D.</small> 109, shows, however, how soon the
disposition for Western supremacy was exhibited,
Victor, the Bishop of Rome, requiring the Asiatic
bishops to conform to the view of his Church respecting
the time at which the festival of Easter should be observed,
and being resisted therein by Polycrates, the Bishop of
Ephesus, on behalf of the Eastern churches, the feud continuing
until the determination of the Council of Nicea.
It was not in Asia alone that the growth of Roman
supremacy was resisted. There is no difficulty in selecting
from ecclesiastical history proofs of the same feeling in
many other quarters. Thus, when the disciples of Montanus,
the Phrygian, who pretended to be the Paraclete,
had converted to their doctrines and austerities the Bishop
of Rome and Tertullian the Carthaginian, on the former
backsliding from that faith, the latter denounced him as a
Patripassian heretic. Yet, for the most part, a good
understanding obtained not only between Rome and
Carthage, but also among the Gallic and Spanish churches,
who looked upon Rome as conspicuous and illustrious,
though as no more than equal to themselves. At the
Council of Carthage St. Cyprian said, "None of us ought to
set himself up as a bishop of bishops, or pretend tyrannically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to restrain his colleagues, because each bishop has a
liberty and power to act as he thinks fit, and can no more
be judged by another bishop than he can judge another.
But we must all wait for the judgment of Jesus Christ, to
whom alone belongs the power to set us over the Church,
and to judge of our actions."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its gradual increase in wealth and influence,</div>

<p>Rome by degrees emerged from this equality, not by
the splendid talents of any illustrious man, for among her
early bishops none rose above mediocrity, but
partly from her political position, partly from
the great wealth she soon accumulated, and
partly from the policy she happened to follow.
Her bishop was not present at the Council of Nicea,
<small>A.D.</small> 325, nor at that of Sardica, <small>A.D.</small> 345; perhaps on these
occasions, as on others of a like kind subsequently, the
immediate motive of his standing aloof was the fear that
he might not receive the presidency. Soon, however, was
discerned the advantage of the system of appearing by
representatives. Such an attitude, moreover, offered the
opportunity of frequently holding the balance of power in
the fierce conflicts that soon arose, made Rome a retreat
for the discomfited ecclesiastic, and her bishop, apparently,
an elevated and unbiased arbiter on his case.
It was thus that Athanasius, in his contests with the
emperor, found a refuge and protector. With this elevated
position in the esteem of strangers came also domestic
dignity. The prodigal gifts of the rich Roman ladies had
already made the bishopric to be sought after by those
who esteem the ease and luxuries of life, as well as by the
ambitious. Fierce contests arose on the occurrence of
vacancies. At the election of Damasus, one hundred and
thirty of the slain lay in the basilica of Sisinnius: the
competitors had called in the aid of a rabble of gladiators,
charioteers, and other ruffians; nor could the riots be
ended except by the intervention of the imperial troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and early corruptions.</div>

<p>It was none too soon that Jerome introduced the monastic
system at Rome&mdash;there was need of a change to
austerity; none too soon that legacy-hunting on
the part of the clergy was prohibited by law&mdash;it had
become a public scandal; none too soon that Jerome
struggled for the patronage of the rich Roman women;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
none too soon that this stern fanatic denounced the immorality
of the Roman clergy, when even the Bishop
Damasus himself was involved in a charge of adultery.
It became clear, if the clergy would hold their ground in
public estimation against their antagonists the monks,
that celibacy must be insisted on. The doctrine of the
pre-eminent value of virginity was steadily making progress;
but it cost many years of struggle before the monks
carried their point, and the celibacy of the clergy became
compulsory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity for an apostolic head.</div>

<p>It had long been seen by those who hoped for Roman
supremacy that there was a necessity for the
establishment of a definite and ascertained doctrine&mdash;a
necessity for recognizing some apostolic
man, who might be the representative of a criterion of
truth. The Eastern system of deciding by councils was
in its nature uncertain. The councils themselves had
no ascertained organization. Experience had shown that
they were too much under the control of the court at
Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity for Councils or a pontiff.</div>

<p>This tendency to accept the republican decisions of
councils in the East, and monarchical ones by a
supreme pontiff in the West, in reality, however,
depended on a common sentiment entertained
by reflecting men everywhere. Something must be done
to check the anarchy of opinion.</p>

<p>To show how this tendency was satisfied, it will be
sufficient to select, out of the numberless controversies of
the times, a few leading ones. A clear light is thrown
upon the matter by the history of the Pelagian, Nestorian,
and Eutychian heresies. Their chronological period is from
about <small>A.D.</small> 400 to <small>A.D.</small> 450.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pelagian controversy</div>

<p>Pelagius was the assumed name of a British monk, who,
about the first of those dates, passed through
Western Europe and Northern Africa, teaching
the doctrines that Adam was by nature mortal, and that,
if he had not sinned, he nevertheless would have died;
that the consequences of his sin were confined to himself,
and did not affect his posterity; that new-born infants
are in the same condition as Adam before his fall; that we
are at birth as pure as he was; that we sin by our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
free will, and in the same manner may reform, and thereby
work out our own salvation; that the grace of God is
given according to our merits. He was repelled from
Africa by the influence of St. Augustine, and denounced
in Palestine from the cell of Jerome. He specially insisted
on this, that it is not the mere act of baptizing by water
that washes away sin, sin can only be removed by good
<span class="sidenote">Effect of Pelagianism on papal superiority.</span>
works. Infants are baptized before it is possible that they
could have sinned. On the contrary, Augustine
resisted these doctrines, resting himself on the
words of Scripture that baptism is for the remission
of sins. The case of children compelled
that father to introduce the doctrine of original sin as
derived from Adam, notwithstanding the dreadful consequences
if they die unbaptized. In like manner also
followed the doctrines of predestination, grace, atonement.</p>

<p>Summoned before a synod at Diospolis, Pelagius was unexpectedly
acquitted of heresy&mdash;an extraordinary decision,
which brought Africa and the East into conflict. Under
these circumstances, perhaps without a clear foresight of the
issue, the matter was referred to Rome as arbiter or judge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Settlement of the Pelagian question by the Africans.</div>

<p>In his decision, Innocent I., magnifying the dignity of the
Roman see and the advantage of such a supreme tribunal,
determined in favour of the African bishops. But scarcely
had he done this when he died, and his successor, Zosimus,
annulled his judgment, and declared the opinions of
Pelagius to be orthodox. Carthage now put
herself in an attitude of resistance. There was
danger of a metaphysical or theological Punic
war. Meantime the wily Africans quietly procured
from the emperor an edict denouncing Pelagius as a
heretic. Through the influence of Count Valerius the
faith of Europe was settled; the heresiarchs and their
accomplices were condemned to exile and forfeiture of
their estates; the contested doctrine that Adam was
created without any liability to death was established by
law; to deny it was a state crime. Thus it appears that
the vacillating papacy was not yet strong enough to exalt
itself above its equals, and the orthodoxy of Europe was
for ever determined by an obscure court intrigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nestorian controversy.</div>

<p>Scarcely was the Pelagian controversy disposed of when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a new heresy appeared. Nestorius, the Bishop of Antioch,
attempted to distinguish between the divine
and human nature of Christ; he considered
that they had become too much confounded, and that "the
God" ought to be kept separate from "the Man." Hence
it followed that the Virgin Mary should not be regarded
as the "Mother of God," but only the "Mother of Christ&mdash;the
God-man." Called by the Emperor Theodosius the
Younger to the episcopate of Constantinople, <small>A.D.</small> 427,
Nestorius was very quickly plunged by the intrigues of a
disappointed faction of that city into disputes with the
populace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrines of Nestorius.</div>

<p>Let us hear the Bishop of Constantinople himself; he is
preaching in the great metropolitan church,
setting forth, with all the eloquence of which
language is capable, the attributes of the illimitable, the
everlasting, the Almighty God. "And can this God have
a mother? The heathen notion of a god born of a mortal
mother is directly confuted by St. Paul, who declares the
Lord to be without father and without mother. Could
a creature bear the uncreated?" He thus insisted that
what was born of Mary was human, and the divine was
added afterwards. At once the monks raised a riot in the
city, and Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, espoused their
cause.</p>

<p>Beneath the outraged orthodoxy of Cyril lay an ill-concealed
motive, the desire of the Bishop of Alexandria
to humble the Bishop of Constantinople. The uproar
commenced with sermons, epistles, addresses. Instigated
by the monks of Alexandria, the monks of Constantinople
took up arms in behalf of "the Mother of God." Again
we remark the eminent position of Rome. Both parties
turn to her as an arbiter. Pope Celestine assembles a
synod. The Bishop of Constantinople is ordered by the
Bishop of Rome to recant, or hold himself under excommunication,
Italian supremacy is emerging through
Oriental disputes, yet not without a struggle. Relying
on his influence at court, Nestorius resists, excommunicates
Cyril, and the emperor summons a council to meet at
Ephesus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overthrow of Nestorianism by the Africans.</div>

<p>To that council Nestorius repaired, with sixteen bishops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and some of the city populace. Cyril collected fifty,
together with a rabble of sailors, bath-men, and women
of the baser sort. The imperial commissioner with his
troops with difficulty repressed the tumult of the assembly.
The rescript was fraudulently read before the
arrival of the Syrian bishops. In one day the
matter was completed; the Virgin's party
triumphed, and Nestorius was deposed. On
the arrival of the Syrian ecclesiastics, a meeting of protest
was held by them. A riot, with much bloodshed, occurred
in the Cathedral of St. John. The emperor was again
compelled to interfere; he ordered eight deputies from
each party to meet him at Chalcedon. In the meantime
court intrigues decided the matter. The emperor's sister
was in after times celebrated by the party of Cyril as
<span class="sidenote">Worship of the Virgin Mary.</span>
having been the cause of the discomfiture of
Nestorius: "the Holy Virgin of the court of
Heaven had found an ally of her own sex in the
holy virgin of the emperor's court." But there were also
other very efficient auxiliaries. In the treasury of the
chief eunuch, which some time after there was occasion to
open, was discovered an acknowledgment of many pounds
of gold received by him from Cyril, through Paul, his
sister's son. Nestorius was abandoned by the court, and
eventually exiled to an Egyptian oasis. An edifying
legend relates that his blasphemous tongue was devoured
by worms, and that from the heats of an Egyptian desert
he escaped only into the hotter torments of Hell.</p>

<p>So, again, in the affair of Nestorius as in that of
Pelagius, Africa triumphed, and the supremacy of Rome,
her ally or confederate, was becoming more and more
distinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Eutychian
controversy.</div>

<p>A very important result in this gradual evolution of
Roman supremacy arose from the affair of Eutyches, the
Archimandrite of a convent of monks at Constantinople.
He had distinguished himself as
a leader in the riots occurring at the time of
Nestorius and in other subsequent troubles. Accused
before a synod held in Constantinople of denying the two
natures of Christ, of saying that if there be two natures
there must be two Sons, Eutyches was convicted, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
sentence of excommunication passed upon him. This
was, however, only the ostensible cause of his condemnation;
the true motive was connected with a court
intrigue. The chief eunuch, who was his godson, was
occupied in a double movement to elevate Eutyches to
the see of Constantinople, and to destroy the authority of
Pulcheria, the emperor's sister, by Eudocia, the emperor's
wife. On his condemnation, Eutyches appealed to the
emperor, who summoned, at the instigation of the eunuch,
a council to meet at Ephesus. This was the celebrated
"Robber Synod," as it was called. It pronounced in
favour of the orthodoxy of Eutyches, and ordered his restoration,
deposing the Bishop of Constantinople, Flavianus,
who was his rival, and at the synod had been his judge
and also Eusebius, who had been his accuser. A riot ensued,
in which the Bishop of Constantinople was murdered
by the Bishop of Alexandria and one Barsumas, who
beat him with their fists amid cries of "Kill him! kill
him!" The Italian legates made their escape from
the uproar with difficulty.</p>

<p>The success of these movements was mainly due to
Dioscorus, the Bishop of Alexandria, who thus accomplished
the overthrow of his rivals of Antioch and Constantinople.
An imperial edict gave force to the determination
of the council. At this point the Bishop of Rome
intervened, refusing to acknowledge the proceedings. It
was well that Alexandria and Constantinople should be
perpetually struggling, but it was not well that either
should become paramount. Dioscorus thereupon broke off
communion with him. Rome and Alexandria were at issue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Another advance of Rome to power through Eutychianism.</div>

<p>In a fortunate moment the emperor died; his sister, the
orthodox Pulcheria, the friend of Leo, married Marcian,
and made him emperor. A council was summoned at
Chalcedon. Leo wished it to be in Italy, where no one
could have disputed his presidency. As it was, he fell
back on the ancient policy, and appeared by
representatives. Dioscorus was overthrown, and
sentence pronounced against him, in behalf of
the council, by one of the representatives of Leo.
It set forth that "Leo, therefore, by their voice, and with
the authority of the council, in the name of the Apostle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Peter, the Rock and foundation of the Church, deposes
Dioscorus from his episcopal dignity, and excludes him
from all Christian rites and privileges."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rivalry
of Constantinople.</div>

<p>But, perhaps that no permanent advantage might accrue
to Rome from the eminent position she was attaining in
these transactions, when most of the prelates had left the
council, a few, who were chiefly of the diocese of
Constantinople, passed, among other canons, one
to the effect that the supremacy of the Roman
see was not in right of its descent from St. Peter, but
because it was the bishopric of an imperial city. It
assigned, therefore, to the Bishop of Constantinople equal
civil dignity and ecclesiastical authority. Rome ever
refused to recognize the validity of this canon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rivalries of the three great bishops.</div>

<p>In these contests of Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria
for supremacy&mdash;for, after all, they were nothing
more than the rivalries of ambitious placemen for power&mdash;the
Roman bishop uniformly came forth the
gainer. And it is to be remarked that he
deserved to be so; his course was always dignified,
often noble; theirs exhibited a reckless scramble
for influence, an unscrupulous resort to bribery, court
intrigue, murder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of ecclesiastical councils.</div>

<p>Thus the want of a criterion of truth, and a determination
to arrest a spirit of inquiry that had become
troublesome, led to the introduction of councils, by which,
in an authoritative manner, theological questions might
be settled. But it is to be observed that these councils
did not accredit themselves by the coincidence of their
decisions on successive occasions, since they often contradicted
one another; nor did they sustain
those decisions only with a moral influence
arising from the understanding of man, enlightened
by their investigations and conclusions. Their
human character is clearly shown by the necessity under
which they laboured of enforcing their arbitrary conclusions
by the support of the civil power. The same
necessity which, in the monarchical East, led thus to the
republican form of a council, led in the democratic West
to the development of the autocratic papal power: but
in both it was found that the final authority thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
appealed to had no innate or divinely derived energy. It
was altogether helpless except by the aid of military or
civil compulsion against any one disposed to resist it.</p>

<p>No other opinion could be entertained of the character
of these assemblages by men of practical ability who had
been concerned in their transactions. Gregory of Nazianzen,
one of the most pious and able men of his age, and
one who, during a part of its sittings, was president of the
Council of Constantinople, <small>A.D.</small> 381, refused subsequently to
attend any more, saying that he had never known an
assembly of bishops terminate well; that, instead of
removing evils, they only increased them, and that their
strifes and lust of power were not to be described. A
thousand years later, Æneas Sylvius, Pope Pius II., speaking
of another council, observes that it was not so much
directed by the Holy Ghost as by the passions of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progressive variation of human thought
manifested by these councils.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the contradictions and opposition
they so frequently exhibit, there may be discerned
in the decisions of these bodies the
traces of an affiliation indicating the continuous
progression of thought. Thus, of the
four &oelig;cumenical councils that were concerned
with the facts spoken of in the preceding pages, that of
Nicea determined the Son to be of the same substance
with the Father; that of Constantinople, that the Son
and Holy Spirit are equal to the Father; that of Ephesus,
that the two natures of Christ make but one person; and
that of Chalcedon, that these natures remain two,
notwithstanding their personal union. But that they
failed of their object in constituting a criterion of truth
is plainly demonstrated by such simple facts as that, in
the fourth century alone, there were thirteen councils
adverse to Arius, fifteen in his favour, and seventeen for
the semi-Arians&mdash;in all, forty-five. From such a confusion,
it was necessary that the councils themselves must be
subordinate to a higher authority&mdash;a higher criterion, able
to give to them or refuse to them authenticity. That the
source of power, both for the council in the East and the
papacy in the West, was altogether political, is proved by
almost every transaction in which they were concerned.
In the case of the papacy, this was well seen in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
contest between Hilary the Bishop of Arles, and Leo, on
which occasion an edict was issued by the Emperor
<span class="sidenote">Pontifical power sustained by physical force.</span>
Valentinian denouncing the contumacy of Hilary, and
setting forth that "though the sentence of so great a
pontiff as the Bishop of Rome did not need
imperial confirmation, yet that it must now
be understood by all bishops that the decrees
of the apostolic see should henceforth be law,
and that whoever refused to obey the citation of the
Roman pontiff should be compelled to do so by the
Moderator of the province." Herein we see the intrinsic
nature of Papal power distinctly. It is allied with
physical force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fall of Rome.</div>

<p>In the midst of these theological disputes occurred that
great event which I have designated as marking
the close of the age of Inquiry. It was
the fall of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of the barbarians.</div>

<p>In the Eastern empire the Goths had become permanently
settled, having laws of their own, a magistracy of
their own, paying no taxes, but contributing 40,000 men
to the army. The Visigoths were spreading through
Greece, Spain, Italy. In their devastations of
the former country, they had spared Athens,
for the sake of her souvenirs. The Eleusinian mysteries
had ceased. From that day Greece never saw prosperity
again. Alaric entered Italy. Stilicho, the imperial
general, forced him to retreat. Rhadogast made his
invasion. Stilicho compelled him to surrender at discretion.
The Burgundians and Vandals overflowed Gaul;
the Suevi, Vandals, and Alans overflowed Spain. Stilicho,
a man worthy of the old days of the republic, though
a Goth, was murdered by the emperor his master.
Alaric appeared before Rome. It was 619 years since she
had felt the presence of a foreign enemy, and that was
Hannibal. She still contained 1780 senatorial palaces,
<span class="sidenote">Capture and sack of Rome by Alaric.</span>
the annual income of some of the owners
of which was 160,000<i>l.</i> The city was eighteen
miles in circumference, and contained above
a million of people&mdash;of people, as in old times clamorous
for distributions of bread, and wine, and oil. In its
conscious despair, the apostate city, it is said, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
consent of the pope, offered sacrifice to Jupiter, its repudiated,
and, as it now believed, its offended god.
200,000<i>l.</i>, together with many costly goods, were paid as
a ransom. The barbarian general retired. He was
insulted by the emperor from his fastness at Ravenna.
Altercations and new marches ensued; and at last, for the
third time, Alaric appeared before Rome. At midnight
on the 24th of April, <small>A.D.</small> 410, eleven hundred and sixty-three
years from the foundation of the city, the Salarian
gate was opened to him by the treachery of slaves; there
was no god to defend her in her dire extremity, and Rome
was sacked by the Goths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accusations of the Pagans against the Christians.</div>

<p>Has the Eternal City really fallen! was the universal
exclamation throughout the empire when it became known
that Alaric had taken Rome. Though paganism had
been ruined in a national sense, the true Roman ethnical
element had never given it up, but was dying out with it,
a relic of the population of the city still adhering
to the ancient faith. Among this were not
wanting many of the aristocratic families and
philosophers, who imputed the disaster to
the public apostasy, and in their shame and suffering
loudly proclaimed that the nation was justly punished for
its abandonment of the gods of its forefathers, the gods
who had given victory and empire. It became necessary
for the Church to meet this accusation, which, while it
was openly urged by thousands, was doubtless believed to
be true by silent, and timid, and panic-stricken millions.
With the intention of defending Christianity, St. Augustine,
one of the ablest of the fathers, solemnly devoted
thirteen years of his life to the composition of his great
work entitled "The City of God." It is interesting for
us to remark the tone of some of these replies of the
Christians to their pagan adversaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Christian reply.</div>

<p>"For the manifest deterioration of Roman manners, and
for the impending dissolution of the state, paganism itself
is responsible. Our political power is only of yesterday;
it is in no manner concerned with the gradual
development of luxury and wickedness, which
has been going on for the last thousand years. Your
ancestors made war a trade; they laid under tribute and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
enslaved the adjacent nations, but were not profusion,
extravagance, dissipation, the necessary consequences of
conquest? was not Roman idleness the inevitable result
of the filling of Italy with slaves? Every hour rendered
wider that bottomless gulf which separates immense riches
from abject poverty. Did not the middle class, in which
reside the virtue and strength of a nation, disappear, and
aristocratic families remain in Rome, whose estates in
Syria or Spain, Gaul or Africa, equalled, nay, even exceeded
in extent and revenue illustrious kingdoms,
provinces for the annexation of which the republic of old
had decreed triumphs? Was there not in the streets a
profligate rabble living in total idleness, fed and amused
at the expense of the state? We are not answerable for
the grinding oppression perpetrated on the rural populations
until they have been driven to despair, their
numbers so diminishing as to warn us that there is
danger of their being extinguished. We did not suggest
to the Emperor Trajan to abandon Dacia, and neglect
that policy which fixed the boundaries of the empire at
strong military posts. We did not suggest to Caracalla to
admit all sorts of people to Roman citizenship, nor dislocate
the population by a wild pursuit of civil offices or the
discharge of military duties. We did not crowd Italy
with slaves, nor make those miserable men more degraded
than the beasts of the field, compelling them to labours
which are the business of the brutes. We have taught
and practised a very different doctrine. We did not
nightly put into irons the population of provinces and
cities reduced to bondage. We are not responsible for the
inevitable insurrections, poisonings, assassinations, vengeance.
We did not bring on that state of things in
which a man having a patrimony found it his best
interest to abandon it without compensation and flee. We
did not demoralize the populace by providing them food,
games, races, theatres; we have been persecuted because
we would not set our feet in a theatre. We did not ruin
the senate and aristocracy by sacrificing everything, even
ourselves, for the Julian family. We did not neutralize
the legions by setting them to fight against one another.
We were not the first to degrade Rome. Diocletian, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
persecuted us, gave the example by establishing his
residence at Nicomedia. As to the sentiment of patriotism
of which you vaunt, was it not destroyed by your own
emperors? When they had made Roman citizens of Gauls
and Egyptians, Africans and Huns, Spaniards and Syrians,
how could they expect that such a motley crew would remain
true to the interests of an Italian town, and that town
their hated oppressor. Patriotism depends on concentration;
it cannot bear diffusion. Something more than
such a worldly tie was wanted to bind the diverse nations
together; they have found it in Christianity. A common
language imparts community of thought and feeling; but
what was to be expected when Greek is the language of
one half of the ruling classes, and Latin of the other?
we say nothing of the thousand unintelligible forms of
speech in use throughout the Roman world. The fall of
the senate preceded, by a few years, the origin of Christianity;
you surely will not say that we were the inciters
of the usurpations of the Cæsars? What have we had to
do with the army, that engine of violence, which, in ninety-two
years gave you thirty-two emperors and twenty-seven
pretenders to the throne? We did not suggest to the
Prætorian Guards to put up the empire to auction.</p>

<p>"Can you really wonder that all this should come to an
end? We do not wonder; on the contrary, we thank God
for it. It is time that the human race had rest. The
sighing of the prisoner, the prayer of the captive, are
heard at last. Yet the judgment has been tempered with
mercy. Had the pagan Rhadogast taken Rome, not a life
would have been spared, no stone left on another. The
Christian Alaric, though a Goth, respects his Christian
brethren, and for their sakes you are saved. As to the
gods, those dæmons in whom you trust, did they always
save you from calamity? How long did Hannibal insult
them? Was it a goose or a god that saved the Capitol
from Brennus? Where were the gods in all the defeats,
some of them but recent, of the pagan emperors? It is
well that the purple Babylon has fallen, the harlot who
was drunk with the blood of nations.</p>

<p>"In the place of this earthly city, this vaunted mistress,
of the world, whose fall closes a long career of superstition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and sin, there shall arise "the City of God." The
purifying fire of the barbarian shall remove her heathenish
defilements, and make her fit for the kingdom of Christ.
Instead of a thousand years of that night of crime, to
which in your despair you look back, there is before her
the day of the millennium, predicted by the prophets of
old. In her regenerated walls there shall be no taint of
sin, but righteousness and peace; no stain of the vanities
of the world, no conflicts of ambition, no sordid hunger
for gold, no lust after glory, no desire for domination,
but holiness to the Lord."</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Augustine's "City of God."</div>

<p>Of those who in such sentiments defended the cause of
the new religion St. Augustine was the chief.
In his great work, "the City of God," which
may be regarded as the ablest specimen of the
early Christian literature, he pursues this theme, if not
in the language, at least in the spirit here presented, and
through a copious detail of many books. On the later
Christianity of the Western churches he has exerted more
influence than any other of the fathers. To him is due
much of the precision of our views on original sin, total
depravity, grace, predestination, election.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life and writings of St. Augustine.</div>

<p>In his early years St. Augustine had led a frivolous and
evil life, plunging into all the dissipations of the gay city
of Carthage. Through the devious paths of
Manichæism, astrology, and scepticism, he at
last arrived at the truth. It was not, however,
the Fathers, but Cicero, to whom the good change was
due; the writings of that great orator won him over to a
love of wisdom, weaning him from the pleasures of the
theatre, the follies of divination and superstition. From
his Manichæan errors, he was snatched by Ambrose, the
Bishop of Milan, who baptized him, together with his
illegitimate son Adeodatus. In his writings we may, without
difficulty, recognize the vestiges of Magianism, not as
regards the duality of God, but as respects the division
of mankind&mdash;the elect and lost; the kingdoms of grace
and perdition, of God and the devil; answering to the
Oriental ideas of the rule of light and darkness. From
Ambrose, St. Augustine learned those high Trinitarian
doctrines which were soon enforced in the West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
In his philosophical disquisitions on Time, Matter,
Memory, this far-famed writer is, however, always unsatisfactory,
often trivial. His doctrine that Scripture,
as the word of God, is capable of a manifold meaning, led
him into many delusions, and exercised, in subsequent
ages, a most baneful influence on true science. Thus
he finds in the Mosaic account of the creation proofs of
the Trinity; that the firmament spoken of therein is the
type of God's word; and that there is a correspondence
between creation itself and the Church. His numerous
books have often been translated, especially his Confessions,
a work that has delighted and edified fifty generations,
but which must, after all, yield the palm, as a
literary production, to the writings of Bunyan, who, like
Augustine, gave himself up to all the agony of unsparing
personal examination and relentless self-condemnation,
anatomizing his very soul, and dragging forth every sin
into the face of day.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical influence of St. Augustine has so
completely eclipsed his political biography, that but little
attention has been given to his conduct in the interesting
time in which he lived. Sismondi recalls to his disadvantage
that he was the friend of Count Boniface, who
invited Genseric and his Vandals into Africa; the bloody
consequences of that conspiracy cannot be exaggerated.
It was through him that the count's name has been
transmitted to posterity without infamy. Boniface
was with him when he died, at Hippo, August 28th,
<small>A.D.</small> 440.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Propitious effect of Alaric's siege.</div>

<p>When Rome thus fell before Alaric, so far from the provincial
Christians bewailing her misfortune,
they actually gloried in it. They critically
distinguished between the downfall of the purple
pagan harlot and the untouched city of God. The vengeance
of the Goth had fallen on the temples, but the churches
had been spared. Though in subsequent and not very
distant calamities of the city these triumphant distinctions
could scarcely be maintained, there can be no doubt that
that catastrophe singularly developed papal power. The
abasement of the ancient aristocracy brought into relief
the bishop. It has been truly said that, as Rome rose from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
her ruins, the bishop was discerned to be her most conspicuous
man. Most opportunely, at this period Jerome
had completed his Latin translation of the Bible. The
Vulgate henceforth became the ecclesiastical authority of
the West. The influence of the heathen classics, which
that austere anchorite had in early life admired, but had
vainly attempted to free himself from by unremitting
nocturnal flagellations, appears in this great version. It
came at a critical moment for the West. In the politic
non-committalism of Rome, it was not expedient that a
pope should be an author. The Vulgate was all that the
times required. Henceforth the East might occupy herself
in the harmless fabrication of creeds and of heresies; the
West could develop her practical talent in the much more
important organization of ecclesiastical power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fate of the three great bishops.</div>

<p>Doubtless not without interest will the reader of these
pages remark how closely the process of ecclesiastical events
resembles that of civil. In both there is an irresistible
tendency to the concentration of power. As in Roman
history we have seen a few families, and, indeed, at last,
one man grasp the influence which in earlier times was
disseminated among the people, so in the Church the congregations
are quickly found in subordination to their
bishops, and these, in their turn, succumbing to a
perpetually diminishing number of their compeers. In
the period we are now considering, the minor
episcopates, such as those of Jerusalem, Antioch,
Carthage, had virtually lost their pristine force,
everything having converged into the three great sees of
Constantinople, Alexandria, and Rome. The history of
the time is a record of the desperate struggles of the three
chief bishops for supremacy. In this conflict Rome
possessed many advantages; the two others were more
immediately under the control of the imperial government,
the clashing of interests between them more frequent, their
rivalry more bitter. The control of ecclesiastical power
was hence perpetually in Rome, though she was, both
politically and intellectually, inferior to her competitors.
As of old, there was a triumvirate in the world destined
to concentrate into a despotism. And, as if to remind
men that the principles involved in the movements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Church are of the same nature as those involved in the
movements of the state, the resemblances here pointed out
are sometimes singularly illustrated in trifling details.
The Bishop of Alexandria was not the first triumvir who
came to an untimely end on the banks of the Nile; the
Roman pontiff was not the first who consolidated his power
by the aid of Gallic legions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The age of Faith.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> policy of Constantine the Great inevitably tended
to the paganization of Christianity. An incorporation of
its pure doctrines with decaying pagan ideas was
the necessary consequence of the control that had been
attained by unscrupulous politicians and placemen. The
faith, thus contaminated, gained a more general
and ready popular acceptance, but at the cost of
a new lease of life to those ideas. So thorough was the
adulteration, that it was not until the Reformation, a period
of more than a thousand years, that a separation of the
true from the false could be accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subdivision of the subject.</div>

<p>Considering how many nations were involved in these
events, and the length of time over which they extend, a
clear treatment of the subject requires its subdivision. I

of the age of Faith in the East, and of the catastrophe that
closed it. I shall then turn to the Age of Faith in the
West&mdash;a long but an instructive story.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">The paganization of Christianity.</div>

<p>The paganization of religion was in no small degree
accomplished by the influence of the females of
the court of Constantinople. It soon manifested
all the essential features of a true mythology
and hero-worship. Helena, the empress-mother, superintended
the building of monumental churches over the reputed
places of interest in the history of our Saviour&mdash;those
of his birth, his burial, his ascension. A vast and ever-increasing
crowd of converts from paganism, who had become
such from worldly considerations, and still hankered after
wonders like those in which their forefathers had from time
immemorial believed, lent a ready ear to assertions which,
to more hesitating or better-instructed minds, would have
<span class="sidenote">Discovery of the true cross and nails.</span>
seemed to carry imposture on their very face. A temple of
Venus, formerly erected on the site of the Holy Sepulchre,
being torn down, there were discovered, in
a cavern beneath, three crosses, and also the
inscription written by Pilate. The Saviour's
cross, being by miracle distinguished from those of the
thieves, was divided, a part being kept at Jerusalem and
a part sent to Constantinople, together with the nails used
in the crucifixion, which were also fortunately found.
These were destined to adorn the head of the emperor's
statue on the top of the porphyry pillar. The wood of
the cross, moreover, displayed a property of growth, and
hence furnished an abundant supply for the demands of
pilgrims, and an unfailing source of pecuniary profit to its
possessors. In the course of subsequent years there was
accumulated in the various churches of Europe, from this
particular relic, a sufficiency to have constructed many
hundred crosses. The age that could accept such a prodigy,
of course found no difficulty in the vision of Constantine
and the story of the Labarum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political causes of paganization.</div>

<p>Such was the tendency of the times to adulterate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Christianity with the spirit of paganism, partly to conciliate
the prejudices of worldly converts, partly
in the hope of securing its more rapid spread.
There is a solemnity in the truthful accusation
which Faustus makes to Augustine: "You have substituted
your agapæ for the sacrifices of the pagans; for their idols
your martyrs, whom you serve with the very same honours.
You appease the shades of the dead with wine and feasts;
you celebrate the solemn festivals of the Gentiles, their
calends and their solstices; and as to their manners, those
you have retained without any alteration. Nothing distinguishes
you from the pagans except that you hold your
assemblies apart from them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relative action of faith and philosophy.</div>

<p>As we have seen in the last chapter, the course of
political affairs had detached the power of the state from
the philosophical and polytheistic parties. Joined to the
new movement, it was not long before it gave significant
proofs of the sincerity of its friendship by commencing an
active persecution of the remnant of philosophy.
It is to be borne in mind that the direction of
the proselytism, which was thus leading to
important results, was from below upward
through society. As to philosophy, its action had been
in the other direction; its depository in the few enlightened,
in the few educated; its course, socially, from above
downward. Under these circumstances, it was obvious
enough that the prejudices of the ignorant populace would
find, in the end, a full expression; that learning would
have no consideration shown to it, or would be denounced as
mere magic; that philosophy would be looked upon as a
vain, and therefore sinful pursuit. When once a political
aspirant has bidden with the multitude for power, and
still depends on their pleasure for effective support, it is
<span class="sidenote">The emperors resist their ecclesiastical allies.</span>
no easy thing to refuse their wishes or hold back from
their demands. Even Constantine himself felt
the pressure of the influence to which he was
allied, and was compelled to surrender his friend
Sopater, the philosopher, who was accused of
binding the winds in an adverse quarter by the influence
of magic, so that the corn-ships could not reach Constantinople;
and the emperor was obliged to give orders for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
his decapitation to satisfy the clamours in the theatre.
Not that such requisitions were submitted to without a
struggle, or that succeeding sovereigns were willing to
make their dignity tacitly subordinate to ecclesiastical
domination. It was the aim of Constantine to make theology
a branch of politics; it was the hope of every bishop
in the empire to make politics a branch of theology.
Already, however, it was apparent that the ecclesiastical
party would, in the end, get the upper hand, and that the
reluctance of some of the emperors to obey its behests
was merely the revolt of individual minds, and therefore
ephemeral in its nature, and that the popular wishes
would be abundantly gratified as soon as emperors arose
who not merely, like Constantine, availed themselves of
Christianity, but absolutely and sincerely adopted it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Emperor Julian.</div>

<p>Julian, by his brief but ineffectual attempt to restore
paganism, scarcely restrained for a moment the course of
the new doctrines now strengthening themselves
continually in public estimation by incorporating
ideas borrowed from paganism. Through the reign of
Valentinian, who was a Nicenist, and of Valens, who was
an Arian, things went on almost as if the episode of Julian
had never occurred. The ancient gods, whose existence
no one seems ever to have denied, were now thoroughly
<span class="sidenote">Persecutions of his successors.</span>
identified with dæmons; their worship was stigmatized as
the practice of magic. Against this crime, regarded by
the laws as equal to treason, a violent persecution
arose. Persons resorting to Rome for the
purposes of study were forbidden to remain there
after they were twenty-one years of age. The force of
this persecution fell practically upon the old religion,
though nominally directed against the black art, for the
primary function of paganism was to foretell future events
in this world, and hence its connexion with divination
and its punishment as magic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of learning to the bishops.</div>

<p>But the persecution, though directed at paganism, struck
also at what remained of philosophy. A great party had
attained to power under circumstances which
compelled it to enforce the principle on which
it was originally founded. That principle was
the exaction of unhesitating belief, which, though it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
answer very well for the humbler and more numerous class
of men, is unsuited for those of a higher intellectual grade.
The policy of Constantine had opened a career in the state,
through the Church, for men of the lowest rank. Many
of such had already attained to the highest dignities. A
burning zeal rather than the possession of profound learning
animated them. But eminent position once attained,
none stood more in need of the appearance of wisdom.
Under such circumstances, they were tempted to set up
their own notions as final and unimpeachable truth, and
to denounce as magic, or the sinful pursuit of vain trifling,
all the learning that stood in the way. In this the hand
of the civil power assisted. It was intended to cut off
every philosopher. Every manuscript that could be seized
was forthwith burned. Throughout the East, men in
terror destroyed their libraries, for fear that some unfortunate
sentence contained in any of the books should
<span class="sidenote">Growth of bigotry and superstition.</span>
involve them and their families in destruction. The universal
opinion was that it was right to compel men to
believe what the majority of society had now
accepted as the truth, and, if they refused, it
was right to punish them. No one in the
dominating party was heard to raise his voice in behalf
of intellectual liberty. The mystery of things above
reason was held to be the very cause that they should be
accepted by Faith; a singular merit was supposed to
appertain to that mental condition in which belief precedes
understanding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fanaticism of Theodosius.</div>

<p>The death-blow to paganism was given by the Emperor
Theodosius, a Spaniard, who, from the services he rendered
in this particular, has been rewarded with the
title of "The Great." From making the practice
of magic and the inspection of the entrails of animals
capital offences, he proceeded to prohibit sacrifices, <small>A.D.</small> 391,
and even the entering of temples. He alienated the
revenues of many temples, confiscated the estates of others,
some he demolished. The vestal virgins he dismissed, and
any house profaned by incense he declared forfeited to the
imperial exchequer. When once the property of a religious
establishment has been irrevocably taken away, it is
needless to declare its worship a capital crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
But not only did the government thus constitute itself a
thorough auxiliary of the new religion; it also tried to
secure it from its own dissensions. Apostates were deprived
of the right of bequeathing their own property. Inquisitors
of faith were established; they were at once spies and
judges, the prototypes of the most fearful tribunal of modern
times. Theodosius, to whom the carrying into effect of
these measures was due, found it, however, more expedient
for himself to institute living emblems of his personal faith
than to rely on any ambiguous creed. He therefore sentenced
all those to be deprived of civil rights, and to be
driven into exile, who did not accord with the belief of
Damasus, the Bishop of Rome, and Peter, the Bishop of
Alexandria. Those who presumed to celebrate Easter on
the same day as the Jews he condemned to death. "We
will," says he, in his edict, "that all who embrace this
creed be called catholic Christians"&mdash;the rest are heretics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Responsibility of the clergy in these events.</div>

<p>Impartial history is obliged to impute the origin of these
tyrannical and scandalous acts of the civil power to the
influence of the clergy, and to hold them responsible
for the crimes. The guilt of impure, unscrupulous
women, eunuchs, parasites, violent
soldiers in possession of absolute power, lies at
their door. Yet human nature can never, in any condition
of affairs, be altogether debased. Though the system
under which men were living pushed them forward to
these iniquities, the individual sense of right and wrong
sometimes vindicated itself. In these pages we shall again
and again meet this personal revolt against the indefensible
consequences of system. It was thus that there were
bishops who openly intervened between the victim and
his oppressor, who took the treasures of the Church to
redeem slaves from captivity. For this a future age will
perhaps excuse Ambrose the Archbishop of Milan, the
impostures he practised, remembering that, face to face,
he held Theodosius the Great to accountability for the
<span class="sidenote">Massacre at Thessalonica.</span>
massacre of seven thousand persons, whom, in a fit of
vengeance, he had murdered in the circus of
Thessalonica, <small>A.D.</small> 390, and inexorably compelled
the imperial culprit, to whom he and all his party were
under such obligations, to atone for his crime by such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
penance as may be exacted in this world, teaching his
sovereign "that though he was of the Church and in the
Church, he was not above the Church;" that brute force
must give way to intellect, and that even the meanest
human being has rights in the sight of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction of Patristicism.</div>

<p>Political events had thus taken a course disastrous to
human knowledge. A necessity had arisen that they to
whom circumstances had given the control of public faith
should also have the control of public knowledge. The
moral condition of the world had thus come into antagonism
with scientific progress. As had been the case many
ages before in India, the sacred writings were
asserted to contain whatever was necessary or
useful for man to know. Questions in astronomy, geography,
chronology, history, or any other branch which
had hitherto occupied or amused the human mind, were
now to be referred to a new tribunal for solution, and
there remained nothing to be done by the philosopher.
A revelation of science is incompatible with any farther
advance; it admits no employment save that of the humble
commentator.</p>

<p>The early ecclesiastical writers, or Fathers, as they are
often called, came thus to be considered not only as surpassing
all other men in piety, but also as excelling them
in wisdom. Their dictum was looked upon as final. This
eminent position they held for many centuries; indeed,
it was not until near the period of the Reformation that
they were deposed. The great critics who appeared at
that time, by submitting the Patristic works to a higher
analysis, comparing them with one another and showing
<span class="sidenote">Apology of the fathers for Patristicism.</span>
their mutual contradictions, brought them all to their
proper level. The habit of even so much as quoting them
went out of use, when it was perceived that not one of
these writers could present the necessary credentials
to entitle him to speak with authority on
any scientific fact. Many of them had not
scrupled to express their contempt of the things they thus
presumed to judge. Thus Eusebius says: "It is not
through ignorance of the things admired by philosophers,
but through contempt of such useless labour, that we think
so little of these matters, turning our souls to the exercise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of better things." In such a spirit Lactantius holds the
whole of philosophy to be "empty and false." Speaking
in reference to the heretical doctrine of the globular form
of the earth, he says: "Is it possible that men can be so
absurd as to believe that the crops and the trees on the
other side of the earth hang downward, and that men have
their feet higher than their heads? If you ask them how
they defend these monstrosities? how things do not fall
away from the earth on that side? they reply that the
nature of things is such, that heavy bodies tend toward
the centre like the spokes of a wheel, while light bodies,
as clouds, smoke, fire, tend from the centre to the heavens
on all sides. Now I am really at a loss what to say of
those who, when they have once gone wrong, steadily persevere
in their folly, and defend one absurd opinion by
another." On the question of the antipodes, St. Augustine
asserts that "it is impossible there should be inhabitants
on the opposite side of the earth, since no such race is
recorded by Scripture among the descendants of Adam."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrines of Patristicism.</div>

<p>Patristicism, or the science of the Fathers, was thus
essentially founded on the principle that the Scriptures
contain all knowledge permitted to man. It followed,
therefore, that natural phenomena may be interpreted by
the aid of texts, and that all philosophical
doctrines must be moulded to the pattern of
orthodoxy. It asserted that God made the world
out of nothing, since to admit the eternity of matter leads
to Manichæism. It taught that the earth is a plane, and
the sky a vault above it, in which the stars are fixed, and
the sun, moon, and planets perform their motions, rising
and setting; that these bodies are altogether of a subordinate
nature, their use being to give light to man; that
still higher and beyond the vault of the sky is heaven, the
abode of God and the angelic hosts; that in six days the
earth, and all that it contains, were made; that it was
overwhelmed by a universal deluge, which destroyed all
living things save those preserved in the ark, the waters
being subsequently dried up by the wind; that man is the
moral centre of the world; for him all things were created
and are sustained; that, so far as his ever having shown
any tendency to improvement, he has fallen both in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
wisdom and worth, the first man, before his sin, having
been perfect in body and soul: hence Patristicism ever
looked backward, never forward; that through that sin
death came into the world; not even any animal had died
previously, but all had been immortal. It utterly rejected
the idea of the government of the world by law, asserting
the perpetual interference of an instant Providence on all
occasions, not excepting the most trifling. It resorted to
spiritual influences in the production of natural effects,
assigning to angels the duty of moving the stars, carrying
up water from the sea to form rain, and managing
eclipses. It affirmed that man had existed but a few
centuries upon earth, and that he could continue only a
little longer, for that the world itself might every moment
be expected to be burned up by fire. It deduced all the
families of the earth from one primitive pair, and made
them all morally responsible for the sin committed by that
pair. It rejected the doctrine that man can modify his
own organism as absolutely irreligious, the physician
being little better than an atheist, but it affirmed that
cures may be effected by the intercession of saints, at the
shrines of holy men, and by relics. It altogether repudiated
the improvement of man's physical state; to
increase his power or comfort was to attempt to attain
what Providence denied; philosophical investigation was
an unlawful prying into things that God had designed to
conceal. It declined the logic of the Greeks, substituting
miracle-proof for it, the demonstration of an assertion
being supposed to be given by a surprising illustration of
something else.</p>

<p>A wild astronomy had thus supplanted the astronomy
of Hipparchus; the miserable fictions of Eusebius had
subverted the chronology of Manetho and Eratosthenes;
the geometry of Euclid and Apollonius was held to be of
no use; the geography of Ptolemy a blunder; the great
mechanical inventions of Archimedes incomparably surpassed
by the miracles worked at the shrines of a hundred
saints.</p>

<p>Of such a mixture of truth and of folly was Patristicism
composed. Ignorance in power had found it necessary to
have a false and unprogressive science, forgetting that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sooner or later the time must arrive when it would be
impossible to maintain stationary ideas in a
<span class="sidenote">Intrinsic weakness of the Patristic system.</span>
world of which the affairs are ever advancing.
A failure to include in the system thus imposed
upon men any provision for intellectual progress
was the great and fatal mistake of those times. Each
passing century brought its incompatibilities. A strain
upon the working of the system soon occurred, and perpetually
increased in force. It became apparent that, in
the end, the imposition would be altogether unable to hold
together. On a future page we shall see what were the
circumstances under which it at last broke down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It commences by extinguishing Greek science.</div>

<p>The wonder-worker who prepares to exhibit his phantasmagoria
upon the wall, knows well how much it adds
to the delusion to have all lights extinguished save that
which is in his own dark lantern. I have now
to relate how the last flickering rays of Greek
learning were put out; how Patristicism, aided
by her companion Bigotry, attempted to lay the foundations
of her influence in security.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acts of the Emperor Theodosius.</div>

<p>In the reign of Theodosius the Great, the pagan religion
and pagan knowledge were together destroyed. This
emperor was restrained by no doubts, for he was very
ignorant and, it must be admitted, was equally sincere
and severe. Among his early measures we find an order
that if any of the governors of Egypt so much
as entered a temple he should be fined fifteen
pounds of gold. He followed this by the destruction
of the temples of Syria. At this period the
Archbishopric of Alexandria was held by one Theophilus,
a bold, bad man, who had once been a monk of Nitria. It
was about <small>A.D.</small> 390. The Trinitarian conflict was at the
time composed, one party having got the better of the
other. To the monks and rabble of Alexandria the temple of
Serapis and its library were doubly hateful, partly because
of the Pantheistic opposition it shadowed forth against
the prevailing doctrine, and partly because within its walls
<span class="sidenote">Alexandrian libraries.</span>
sorcery, magic, and other dealings with the devil had for
ages been going on. We have related how
Ptolemy Philadelphus commenced the great
library in the aristocratic quarter of the city named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Bruchion, and added various scientific establishments to
it. Incited by this example, Eumenes, King of Pergamus,
established out of rivalry a similar library in his metropolis.
With the intention of preventing him from excelling that
of Egypt, Ptolemy Epiphanes prohibited the exportation
of papyrus, whereupon Eumenes invented the art of
making parchment. The second great Alexandrian library
was that established by Ptolemy Physcon at the Serapion,
in the adjoining quarter of the town. The library in
the Bruchion, which was estimated to contain 400,000
volumes, was accidentally, or, as it has been said, purposely
burned during the siege of the city by Julius
<span class="sidenote">Library of Pergamus transferred to Egypt.</span>
Cæsar, but that in the Serapion escaped. To make
amends for this great catastrophe, Marc Antony presented
to Cleopatra the rival library, brought for that
purpose from Pergamus. It consisted of 200,000
volumes. It was with the library in the
Bruchion that the Museum was originally connected;
but after its conflagration, the remains of the
various surviving establishments were transferred to the
Serapion, which therefore was, at the period of which we
are speaking, the greatest depository of knowledge in the
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The temple of Serapis.</div>

<p>The pagan Roman emperors had not been unmindful of
the great trust they had thus inherited from the Ptolemies.
The temple of Serapis was universally admitted
to be the noblest religious structure in the
world, unless perhaps the patriotic Roman excepted that
of the Capitoline Jupiter. It was approached by a vast
flight of steps; was adorned with many rows of columns;
and in its quadrangular portico&mdash;a matchless work of skill&mdash;were
placed most exquisite statues. On the sculptured
walls of its chambers, and upon ceilings, were paintings of
unapproachable excellence. Of the value of these works
of art the Greeks were no incompetent judges.</p>

<p>The Serapion, with these its precious contents, perpetually
gave umbrage to the Archbishop Theophilus and
his party. To them it was a reproach and an insult. Its
many buildings were devoted to unknown, and therefore
unholy uses. In its vaults and silent chambers the
populace believed that the most abominable mysteries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
were carried on. There were magical brazen circles and
sun-dials for fortune-telling in its porch; every one said
that they had once belonged to Pharaoh or the conjurors
who strove with Moses. Alas! no one of the ferocious
bigots knew that with these Eratosthenes had in the old
times measured the size of the earth, and Timocharis had
determined the motions of the planet Venus. The temple,
with its pure white marble walls, and endless columns
projected against a blue and cloudless Egyptian sky, was
to them a whited sepulchre full of rottenness within. In
the very sanctuary of the god it was said that the priests
had been known to delude the wealthiest and most beautiful
Alexandrian women, who fancied that they were
honoured by the raptures of the god. To this temple, so
well worthy of their indignation, Theophilus directed the
attention of his people. It happened that the Emperor
Constantius had formerly given to the Church the site of
<span class="sidenote">Quarrel between the Christians and pagans in Alexandria.</span>
an ancient temple of Osiris, and, in digging the foundation
for the new edifice, the obscene symbols used in that
worship chanced to be found. With more zeal than
modesty, Theophilus exhibited them to the derision of the
rabble in the market-place. The old Egyptian pagan party
rose to avenge the insult. A riot ensued, one
Olympius, a philosopher, being the leader.
Their head-quarters were in the massive building
of the Serapion, from which issuing forth they
seized whatever Christians they could, compelled them to
offer sacrifice, and then killed them on the altar. The
dispute was referred to the emperor, in the meantime the
pagans maintaining themselves in the temple-fortress. In
the dead of night, Olympius, it is said, was awe-stricken by
the sound of a clear voice chanting among the arches and
<span class="sidenote">Theodosius orders the Serapion to be destroyed.</span>
pillars the Christian Alleluia. Either accepting, like a
heathen, the omen, or fearing a secret assassin, he escaped
from the temple and fled for his life. On the
arrival of the rescript of Theodosius the pagans
laid down their arms, little expecting the orders
of the emperor. He enjoined that the building
should forthwith be destroyed, intrusting the task to the
swift hands of Theophilus. His work was commenced by
the pillage and dispersal of the library. He entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sanctuary of the god&mdash;that sanctuary which was the
visible sign of the Pantheism of the East, the memento of
the alliance between hoary primeval Egypt and free-thinking
<span class="sidenote">Statue of Serapis is destroyed.</span>
Greece, the relic of the statesmanship of Alexander's
captains. In gloomy silence the image
of Serapis confronted its assailants. It is in
such a moment that the value of a religion is
tried; the god who cannot defend himself is a convicted
sham. Theophilus, undaunted, commands a veteran to
strike the image with his battle-axe. The helpless statue
offers no resistance. Another blow rolls the head of the
idol on the floor. It is said that a colony of frightened
rats ran forth from its interior. The kingcraft, and
priestcraft, and solemn swindle of seven hundred years are
exploded in a shout of laughter; the god is broken to
pieces, his members dragged through the streets. The
recesses of the Serapion are explored. Posterity is edified by
discoveries of frauds by which the priests maintain their
power. Among other wonders, a car with four horses is
seen suspended near the ceiling by means of a magnet
laid on the roof, which being removed by the hand of a
Christian, the imposture fell to the pavement. The historian
of these events, noticing the physical impossibility
of such things, has wisely said that it is more easy to
invent a fictitious story than to support a practical fraud.
But the gold and silver contained in the temple were
carefully collected, the baser articles being broken in
pieces or cast into the fire. Nor did the holy zeal of
Theophilus rest until the structure was demolished to its
very foundations&mdash;a work of no little labour&mdash;and a
church erected in the precincts. It must, however, have
been the temple more particularly which experienced this
devastation. The building in which the library had been
contained must have escaped, for, twenty years subsequently,
Orosius expressly states that he saw the empty
cases or shelves. The fanatic Theophilus pushed forward
<span class="sidenote">Persecutions of Theophilus.</span>
his victory. The temple at Canopus next fell before him,
and a general attack was made on all similar edifices in
Egypt. Speaking of the monks and of the
worship of relics, Eunapius says: "Whoever
wore a black dress was invested with tyrannical power;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
philosophy and piety to the gods were compelled to retire
into secret places, and to dwell in contented poverty and
dignified meanness of appearance. The temples were turned
into tombs for the adoration of the bones of the basest and
most depraved of men, who had suffered the penalty of the
law, and whom they made their gods."</p>

<p>Such was the end of the Serapion. Its destruction stands
forth a token to all ages of the state of the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Cyril.</div>

<p>In a few years after this memorable event the Archbishop
Theophilus had gone to his account. His throne
was occupied by his nephew, St. Cyril, who had
been expressly prepared for that holy and responsible
office by a residence of five years among the monks
of Nitria. He had been presented to the fastidious Alexandrians
with due precautions, and by them acknowledged
to be an effective and fashionable preacher. His pagan
opponents, however, asserted that the clapping of hands
and encores bestowed on the more elaborate passages of
his sermons were performed by persons duly arranged in
the congregation, and paid for their trouble. If doubt
remains as to his intellectual endowments, there can be
none respecting the qualities of his heart. The three
parties into which the population of the city was divided&mdash;Christian,
Heathen, and Jewish&mdash;kept up a perpetual
disorder by their disputes. Of the last it is said that the
number was not less than forty thousand. The episcopate
itself had become much less a religious than an important
civil office, exercising a direct municipal control through
the Parabolani, which, under the disguise of city missionaries,
whose duty it was to seek out the sick and destitute,
<span class="sidenote">Determines on supremacy in Alexandria.<br /><br />
Riots in that city.</span>
constituted in reality a constabulary force, or rather
actually a militia. The unscrupulous manner in which
Cyril made use of this force, diverting it from
its ostensible purpose, is indicated by the fact
that the emperor was obliged eventually to take
the appointments to it out of the archbishop's hands, and
reduce the number to five or six hundred. Some local
circumstances had increased the animosity between the
Jews and the Christians, and riots had taken
place between them in the theatre. These were
followed by more serious conflicts in the streets; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Jews, for the moment having the advantage over their
antagonists, outraged and massacred them. It was,
however, but for a moment; for, the Christians arousing
themselves under the inspirations of Cyril, a mob sacked
the synagogues, pillaged the houses of the Jews, and endeavoured
to expel those offenders out of the city. The
prefect Orestes was compelled to interfere to stop the riot;
but the archbishop was not so easily disposed of. His old
associates, the Nitrian monks, now justified the prophetic
forecast of Theophilus. Five hundred of those fanatics
swarmed into the town from the desert. The prefect
himself was assaulted, and wounded in the head by a stone
thrown by Ammonius, one of them. The more respectable
citizens, alarmed at the turn things were taking, interfered,
and Ammonius, being seized, suffered death at the
hands of the lictor. Cyril, undismayed, caused his body
to be transported to the Cæsareum, laid there in state, and
buried with unusual honours. He directed that the name
of the fallen zealot should be changed from Ammonius to
Thaumasius, or "the Wonderful," and the holy martyr
received the honours of canonization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hypatia.</div>

<p>In these troubles there can be no doubt that the pagans
sympathized with the Jews, and therefore drew upon
themselves the vengeance of Cyril. Among the cultivators
of Platonic philosophy whom the times
had spared, there was a beautiful young woman,
Hypatia, the daughter of Theon the mathematician, who
not only distinguished herself by her expositions of the
Neo-Platonic and Peripatetic doctrines, but was also
honoured for the ability with which she commented on
the writings of Apollonius and other geometers. Every
day before her door stood a long train of chariots; her
lecture-room was crowded with the wealth and fashion of
Alexandria. Her aristocratic audiences were more than
a rival to those attending upon the preaching of the archbishop,
and perhaps contemptuous comparisons were instituted
between the philosophical lectures of Hypatia and
the incomprehensible sermons of Cyril. But if the archbishop
had not philosophy, he had what on such occasions
is more valuable&mdash;power. It was not to be borne that a
heathen sorceress should thus divide such a metropolis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
with a prelate; it was not to be borne that the rich, and
noble, and young should thus be carried off by the black
<span class="sidenote">The city of Alexandria.</span>
arts of a diabolical enchantress. Alexandria was too fair a
prize to be lightly surrendered. It could vie with
Constantinople itself. Into its streets, from the
yellow sand-hills of the desert, long trains of camels and
countless boats brought the abundant harvests of the Nile.
A ship-canal connected the harbour of Eunostos with Lake
Mareotis. The harbour was a forest of masts. Seaward,
looking over the blue Mediterranean, was the great lighthouse,
the Pharos, counted as one of the wonders of the
world; and to protect the shipping from the north wind
there was a mole three quarters of a mile in length, with
its drawbridges, a marvel of the skill of the Macedonian
engineers. Two great streets crossed each other at right
angles&mdash;one was three, the other one mile long. In the
square where they intersected stood the mausoleum in
which rested the body of Alexander. The city was full of
noble edifices&mdash;the palace, the exchange, the Cæsareum,
the halls of justice. Among the temples, those of Pan
and Neptune were conspicuous. The visitor passed
countless theatres, churches, temples, synagogues. There
was a time before Theophilus when the Serapion might
have been approached on one side by a slope for carriages,
on the other by a flight of a hundred marble steps. On
these stood the grand portico with its columns, its
chequered corridor leading round a roofless hall, the adjoining
porches of which contained the library, and from
the midst of its area arose a lofty pillar visible afar off at
sea. On one side of the town were the royal docks, on the
other the Hippodrome, and on appropriate sites the Necropolis,
the market-places, the gymnasium, its stoa being a
stadium long; the amphitheatre, groves, gardens, fountains,
obelisks, and countless public buildings with gilded
roofs glittering in the sun. Here might be seen the
wealthy Christian ladies walking in the streets, their
dresses embroidered with Scripture parables, the Gospels
hanging from their necks by a golden chain, Maltese dogs
with jewelled collars frisking round them, and slaves with
parasols and fans trooping along. There might be seen
the ever-trading, ever-thriving Jew, fresh from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
wharves, or busy negotiating his loans. But, worst of all,
the chariots with giddy or thoughtful pagans hastening
to the academy of Hypatia, to hear those questions discussed
which have never yet been answered, "Where am
I?" "What am I?" "What can I know?"&mdash;to hear discourses
on antenatal existence, or, as the vulgar asserted,
to find out the future by the aid of the black art, soothsaying
by Chaldee talismans engraved on precious stones,
by incantations with a glass and water, by moonshine on
the walls, by the magic mirror, the reflection of a sapphire,
a sieve, or cymbals; fortune-telling by the veins of the
hand, or consultations with the stars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of Hypatia by Cyril.</div>

<p>Cyril at length determined to remove this great reproach,
and overturn what now appeared to be the only
obstacle in his way to uncontrolled authority in the city.
We are reaching one of those moments in which great
general principles embody themselves in individuals. It
is Greek philosophy under the appropriate form of
Hypatia; ecclesiastical ambition under that of Cyril.
Their destinies are about to be fulfilled. As
Hypatia comes forth to her academy, she is
assaulted by Cyril's mob&mdash;an Alexandrian mob
of many monks. Amid the fearful yelling of these bare-legged
and black-cowled fiends she is dragged from her
chariot, and in the public street stripped naked. In her
mortal terror she is haled into an adjacent church, and in
that sacred edifice is killed by the club of Peter the Reader.
It is not always in the power of him who has stirred up
the worst passions of a fanatical mob to stop their excesses
when his purpose is accomplished. With the blow given
by Peter the aim of Cyril was reached, but his merciless
adherents had not glutted their vengeance. They outraged
the naked corpse, dismembered it, and incredible to
be said, finished their infernal crime by scraping the flesh
from the bones with oyster-shells, and casting the remnants
into the fire. Though in his privacy St. Cyril and
his friends might laugh at the end of his antagonist, his
memory must bear the weight of the righteous indignation
of posterity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suppression of Alexandrian science.</div>

<p>Thus, in the 414th year of our era, the position of philosophy
in the intellectual metropolis of the world was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
determined; henceforth science must sink into obscurity
and subordination. Its public existence will no
longer be tolerated. Indeed, it may be said that
from this period for some centuries it altogether
disappeared. The leaden mace of bigotry had struck and
shivered the exquisitely tempered steel of Greek philosophy.
Cyril's acts passed unquestioned. It was now
ascertained that throughout the Roman world there must
be no more liberty of thought. It had been said that
these events prove Greek philosophy to have been a sham,
and, like other shams, it was driven out of the world when
detected, and that it could not withstand the truth. Such
assertions might answer their purposes very well, so long
as the victors maintained their power in Alexandria, but
they manifestly are of inconvenient application after the
Saracens had captured the city. However this may be, an
intellectual stagnation settled upon the place, an invisible
atmosphere of oppression, ready to crush down, morally
and physically, whatever provoked its weight. And so
for the next two dreary and weary centuries things remained,
until oppression and force were ended by a foreign
invader. It was well for the world that the Arabian
conquerors avowed their true argument, the scimitar, and
made no pretensions to superhuman wisdom. They were
thus left free to pursue knowledge without involving
themselves in theological contradictions, and were able to
make Egypt once more illustrious among the nations of
the earth&mdash;to snatch it from the hideous fanaticism, ignorance,
and barbarism into which it had been plunged. On
the shore of the Red Sea once more a degree of the earth's
surface was to be measured, and her size ascertained&mdash;but
by a Mohammedan astronomer. In Alexandria the
memory of the illustrious old times was to be recalled by
the discovery of the motion of the sun's apogee by
Albategnius, and the third inequality of the moon, the
variation, by Aboul Wefa; to be discovered six centuries
later in Europe by Tycho Brahe. The canal of the
Pharaohs from the Nile to the Red Sea, cleared out by the
Ptolemies in former ages, was to be cleared from its sand
again. The glad desert listened once more to the cheerful
cry of the merchant camel-driver instead of the midnight
prayer of the monk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three attacks made upon the Byzantine system.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> now to describe the end of the age of Faith in the
East. The Byzantine system, out of which it
had issued, was destroyed by three attacks: 1st,
by the Vandal invasion of Africa; 2nd, by the
military operations of Chosroes, the Persian
king; 3rd, by Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>Of these three attacks, the Vandal may be said, in a
military sense, to have been successfully closed by the
victories of Justinian; but, politically, the cost of those
victories was the depopulation and ruin of the empire, particularly
in the south and west. The second, the Persian
attack, though brilliantly resisted in its later years by the
Emperor Heraclius, left, throughout the East, a profound
moral impression, which proved final and fatal in the
Mohammedan attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vandal attack.</div>

<p>No heresy has ever produced such important political
results as that of Arius. While it was yet a vital doctrine,
it led to the infliction of unspeakable calamities on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
empire, and, though long ago forgotten, has blasted permanently
some of the fairest portions of the globe.
When Count Boniface, incited by the intrigues
of the patrician Ætius, invited Genseric, the King of the
Vandals, into Africa, that barbarian found in the discontented
sectaries his most effectual aid. In vain would
he otherwise have attempted the conquest of the country
<span class="sidenote">Conquest of Africa.</span>
with the 50,000 men he landed from Spain, <small>A.D.</small> 429.
Three hundred Donatist bishops, and many
thousand priests, driven to despair by the
persecutions inflicted by the emperor, carrying with them
that large portion of the population who were Arian, were
ready to look upon him as a deliverer, and therefore to
afford him support. The result to the empire was the loss
of Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reign of Justinian.</div>

<p>It was nothing more than might have been expected that
Justinian, when he found himself firmly seated on the
throne of Constantinople, should make an attempt to
retrieve these disasters. The principles which led him to
his scheme of legislation; to the promotion of
manufacturing interests by the fabrication of
silk; to the reopening of the ancient routes to India, so as
to avoid transit through the Persian dominions; to his
attempt at securing the carrying trade of Europe for the
Greeks, also suggested the recovery of Africa. To this
important step he was urged by the Catholic clergy. In a
sinister but suitable manner, his reign was illustrated by
his closing the schools of philosophy at Athens, ostensibly
because of their affiliation to paganism, but in reality on
account of his detestation of the doctrines of Aristotle and
Plato; by the abolition of the consulate of Rome; by the
extinction of the Roman senate, <small>A.D.</small> 552; by the capture
and recapture five times of the Eternal City. The vanishing
of the Roman race was thus marked by an extinction
of the instruments of ancient philosophy and power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His reconquest of Africa.</div>

<p>The indignation of the Catholics was doubtless justly
provoked by the atrocities practised in the Arian behalf
by the Vandal kings of Africa, who, among other cruelties,
had attempted to silence some bishops by cutting
out their tongues. To carry out Justinian's
intention of the recovery of Africa, his general Belisarius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
sailed at midsummer, <small>A.D.</small> 533, and in November he had
completed the reconquest of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dreadful calamities produced by him.</div>

<p>This was speedy work, but it was followed by fearful
calamities; for in this, and the Italian wars of
Justinian, likewise undertaken at the instance
of the orthodox clergy, the human race visibly
diminished. It is affirmed that in the African
campaign five millions of the people of that country were
consumed; that during the twenty years of the Gothic
War Italy lost fifteen millions; and that the wars, famines,
and pestilences of the reign of Justinian diminished the
human species by the almost incredible number of one
hundred millions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Persian attack.</div>

<p>It is therefore not at all surprising that in such a
deplorable condition men longed for a deliverer, in their
despair totally regardless who he might be or from what
quarter he might come. Ecclesiastical partisanship had
done its work. When Chosroes II., the Persian
monarch, <small>A.D.</small> 611, commenced his attack, the
persecuted sectaries of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt
followed the example of the African Arians in the Vandal
invasion, and betrayed the empire. The revenge of an
oppressed heretic is never scrupulous about its means of
<span class="sidenote">Fall and pillage of Jerusalem.</span>
gratification. As might have been expected, the cities of
Asia fell before the Persians. They took Jerusalem
by assault, and with it the cross of Christ;
ninety thousand Christians were massacred;
and in its very birthplace Christianity was displaced
by Magianism. The shock which religious men received
through this dreadful event can hardly now be realized.
The imposture of Constantine bore a bitter fruit; the
sacred wood which had filled the world with its miracles
was detected to be a helpless counterfeit, borne off in
triumph by deriding blasphemers. All confidence in the
<span class="sidenote">Triumphs of Chosroes.</span>
apostolic powers of the Asiatic bishops was lost; not one
of them could work a wonder for his own salvation in the
dire extremity. The invaders overran Egypt as far as
Ethiopia; it seemed as if the days of Cambyses
had come back again. The Archbishop of
Alexandria found it safer to flee to Cyprus than to defend
himself by spiritual artifices or to rely on prayer. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Mediterranean shore to Tripoli was subdued. For ten
years the Persian standards were displayed in view of
Constantinople. At one time Heraclius had determined to
abandon that city, and make Carthage the metropolis of
the empire. His intention was defeated by the combination
of the patriarch, who dreaded the loss of his position;
of the aristocracy, who foresaw their own ruin; and of the
people, who would thus be deprived of their largesses and
shows. Africa was more truly Roman than any other of
the provinces; it was there that Latin was last used. But
when the vengeance of the heretical sects was satisfied,
they found that they had only changed the tyrant without
escaping the tyranny. The magnitude of their treason
was demonstrated by the facility with which Heraclius
expelled the Persians as soon as they chose to assist him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral impression of these events.</div>

<p>In vain, after these successes, what was passed off as
the true cross was restored again to Jerusalem&mdash;the charm
was broken. The Magian fire had burnt the sepulchre of
Christ, and the churches of Constantine and
Helena; the costly gifts of the piety of three
centuries were gone into the possession of the
Persian and the Jew. Never again was it possible that
faith could be restored. They who had devoutly expected
that the earth would open, the lightning descend, or
sudden death arrest the sacrilegious invader of the holy
places, and had seen that nothing of the kind ensued,
dropped at once into dismal disbelief. Asia and Africa
were already morally lost. The scimitar of the Arabian
soon cut the remaining tie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of Mohammed.</div>

<p>Four years after the death of Justinian, <small>A.D.</small> 569, was
born at Mecca, in Arabia, the man who, of all
men, has exercised the greatest influence upon
the human race&mdash;Mohammed, by Europeans surnamed "the
Impostor." He raised his own nation from Fetichism, the
adoration of a meteoric stone, and from the basest idol-worship;
he preached a monotheism which quickly
scattered to the winds the empty disputes of the Arians
and Catholics, and irrevocably wrenched from Christianity
more than half, and that by far the best half of her
possessions, since it included the Holy Land, the birthplace
of our faith, and Africa, which had imparted to it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
its Latin form. That continent, and a very large part of
Asia, after the lapse of more than a thousand years, still
remain permanently attached to the Arabian doctrine.
With the utmost difficulty, and as if by miracle, Europe
itself escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His preaching,</div>

<p>Mohammed possessed that combination of qualities which
more than once has decided the fate of empires. A
preaching soldier, he was eloquent in the pulpit,
valiant in the field. His theology was simple:
"There is but one God." The effeminate Syrian, lost in
Monothelite and Monophysite mysteries; the Athanasian
and Arian, destined to disappear before his breath, might
readily anticipate what he meant. Asserting that everlasting
truth, he did not engage in vain metaphysics, but
applied himself to improving the social condition of his
people by regulations respecting personal cleanliness,
sobriety, fasting, prayer. Above all other works he
esteemed almsgiving and charity. With a liberality to
which the world had of late become a stranger, he admitted
the salvation of men of any form of faith provided they
were virtuous. To the declaration that there is but one
God, he added, "and Mohammed is his Prophet." Whoever
<span class="sidenote">and title to apostleship.</span>
desires to know whether the event of things answered
to the boldness of such an announcement, will do well to
examine a map of the world in our own times.
He will find the marks of something more
than an imposture. To be the religious head of many
empires, to guide the daily life of one-third of the human
race, may perhaps justify the title of a messenger of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His delusions.</div>

<p>Like many of the Christian monks, Mohammed retired
to the solitude of the desert, and, devoting himself to
meditation, fasting, and prayer, became the victim of
cerebral disorder. He was visited by supernatural appearances,
mysterious voices accosting him as the
Prophet of God; even the stones and trees joined
in the whispering. He himself suspected the true nature
of his malady, and to his wife Chadizah he expressed a
dread that he was becoming insane. It is related that as
they sat alone, a shadow entered the room. "Dost thou
see aught?" said Chadizah, who, after the manner of
Arabian matrons, wore her veil. "I do," said the prophet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Whereupon she uncovered her face and said, "Dost thou
see it now?" "I do not." "Glad tidings to thee, O
Mohammed!" exclaimed Chadizah: "it is an angel, for he
has respected my unveiled face; an evil spirit would not."
As his disease advanced, these spectral illusions became
more frequent; from one of them he received the divine
commission. "I," said his wife, "will be thy first believer;"
and they knelt down in prayer together. Since
that day nine thousand millions of human beings have
acknowledged him to be a prophet of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His gradual antagonism to Christianity.</div>

<p>Though, in the earlier part of his career, Mohammed
exhibited a spirit of forbearance toward the Christians, it
was not possible but that bitter animosity should arise, as
the sphere of his influence extended. He appears to have
been unable to form any other idea of the Trinity
than that of three distinct gods; and the worship
of the Virgin Mary, recently introduced, could
not fail to come into irreconcilable conflict with
his doctrine of the unity of God. To his condemnation
of those Jews who taught that Ezra was the Son of
God, he soon added bitter denunciations of the Oriental
churches because of their idolatrous practices. The Koran
is full of such rebukes: "Verily, Christ Jesus, the Son of
Mary, is the apostle of God." "Believe, therefore, in God
and his apostles, and say not that there are three gods.
Forbear this; it will be better for you. God is but one
God. Far be it from Him that he should have a son."
"In the last day, God shall say unto Jesus, O Jesus, son
of Mary! hast thou ever said to men, Take me and my
mother for two gods beside God? He shall say, Praise be
unto thee, it is not for me to say that which I ought not."
Mohammed disdained all metaphysical speculations respecting
the nature of the Deity, or of the origin and existence
of sin, topics which had hitherto exercised the ingenuity
of the East. He cast aside the doctrine of the superlative
<span class="sidenote">Institution of polygamy.</span>
value of chastity, asserting that marriage is the natural
state of man. To asceticism he opposed polygamy,
permitting the practice of it in this life
and promising the most voluptuous means for its enjoyment
in Paradise hereafter, especially to those who had gained
the crowns of martyrdom or of victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of his life.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Too often, in this world, success is the criterion of right.
The Mohammedan appeals to the splendour and rapidity
of his career as a proof of the divine mission of
his apostle. It may, however, be permitted to a
philosopher, who desires to speak of the faith of so large
a portion of the human race with profound respect, to
examine what were some of the secondary causes which
led to so great a political result. From its most glorious
seats Christianity was for ever expelled: from Palestine,
the scene of its most sacred recollections; from Asia Minor,
that of its first churches; from Egypt, whence issued the
great doctrine of Trinitarian orthodoxy; from Carthage,
who imposed her belief on Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of his success.</div>

<p>It is altogether a misconception that the Arabian progress
was due to the sword alone. The sword may
change an acknowledged national creed, but it
cannot affect the consciences of men. Profound though its
argument is, something far more profound was demanded
before Mohammedanism pervaded the domestic life of Asia
and Africa, before Arabic became the language of so many
different nations.</p>

<p>The explanation of this political phenomenon is to be
found in the social condition of the conquered countries.
The influences of religion in them had long ago ceased;
it had become supplanted by theology&mdash;a theology so incomprehensible
that even the wonderful capabilities of the
Greek language were scarcely enough to meet its subtle
demands; the Latin and the barbarian dialects were out of
the question. How was it possible that unlettered men, who
with difficulty can be made to apprehend obvious things,
should understand such mysteries? Yet they were taught
that on those doctrines the salvation or damnation of the
human race depended. They saw that the clergy had
abandoned the guidance of the individual life of their flocks;
that personal virtue or vice were no longer considered;
that sin was not measured by evil works but by the degrees
of heresy. They saw that the ecclesiastical chiefs of Rome,
Constantinople, and Alexandria were engaged in a desperate
struggle for supremacy, carrying out their purposes
by weapons and in ways revolting to the conscience of
man. What an example when bishops were concerned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
assassinations, poisonings, adulteries, blindings, riots,
<span class="sidenote">Civil weakness produced by ecclesiastical demoralization.</span>
treasons, civil war; when patriarchs and primates
were excommunicating and anathematizing one
another in their rivalries for earthly power,
bribing eunuchs with gold, and courtesans and
royal females with concessions of episcopal love, and influencing
the decisions of councils asserted to speak with
the voice of God by those base intrigues and sharp practices
resorted to by demagogues in their packed assemblies!
Among legions of monks, who carried terror into the
imperial armies and riot into the great cities, arose hideous
clamours for theological dogmas, but never a voice for
intellectual liberty or the outraged rights of man. In such
a state of things, what else could be the result than disgust
or indifference? Certainly men could not be expected, if a
time of necessity arose, to give help to a system that had
lost all hold on their hearts.</p>

<p>When, therefore, in the midst of the wrangling of sects,
in the incomprehensible jargon of Arians, Nestorians,
Eutychians, Monothelites, Monophysites, Mariolatrists, and
an anarchy of countless disputants, there sounded through
the world, not the miserable voice of the intriguing majority
of a council, but the dread battle-cry, "There is but
one God," enforced by the tempest of Saracen armies, is it
surprising that the hubbub was hushed? Is it surprising
that all Asia and Africa fell away? In better times
patriotism is too often made subordinate to religion; in
those times it was altogether dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conquest of Africa.</div>

<p>Scarcely was Mohammed buried when his religion manifested
its inevitable destiny of overpassing the bounds
of Arabia. The prophet himself had declared war against
the Roman empire, and, at the head of 30,000
men, advanced toward Damascus, but his purpose
was frustrated by ill health. His successor Abu-Bekr,
the first khalif, attacked both the Romans and the Persians.
The invasion of Egypt occurred <small>A.D.</small> 638, the Arabs being
invited by the Copts. In a few months the Mohammedan
general Amrou wrote to his master, the khalif, "I have
taken Alexandria, the great city of the West." Treason
had done its work, and Egypt was thoroughly subjugated.
To complete the conquest of Christian Africa, many attacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
were nevertheless required. Abdallah penetrated nine
hundred miles to Tripoli, but returned. Nothing more
was done for twenty years, because of the disputes that
arose about the succession to the khalifate. Then Moawiyah
sent his lieutenant, Akbah, who forced his way to the
Atlantic, but was unable to hold the long line of country
permanently. Again operations were undertaken by
Abdalmalek, the sixth of the Ommiade dynasty, <small>A.D.</small> 698;
his lieutenant, Hassan, took Carthage by storm and destroyed
it, the conquest being at last thoroughly completed
by Musa, who enjoyed the double reputation of a brave
soldier and an eloquent preacher. And thus this region,
distinguished by its theological acumen, to which modern
Europe owes so much, was for ever silenced by the scimitar.
It ceased to preach and was taught to pray.</p>

<p>In this political result&mdash;the Arabian conquest of Africa&mdash;there
can be no doubt that the same element which exercised
in the Vandal invasion so disastrous an effect, came again
into operation. But, if treason introduced the enemy,
polygamy secured the conquest. In Egypt the Greek
population was orthodox, the natives were Jacobites, more
willing to accept the Monotheism of Arabia than to bear
the tyranny of the orthodox. The Arabs, carrying out their
policy of ruining an old metropolis and erecting a new
one, dismantled Alexandria; and thus the patriarchate of
that city ceased to have any farther political existence in
the Christian system, which for so many ages had been
disturbed by its intrigues and violence. The irresistible
effect of polygamy in consolidating the new order of things
soon became apparent. In little more than a single generation
all the children of the north of Africa were speaking
Arabic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conquest of Syria and Persia.</div>

<p>During the khalifates of Abu-Bekr and Omar, and within
twelve years after the death of Mohammed, the
Arabians had reduced thirty-six thousand cities,
towns, and castles in Persia, Syria, Africa, and
had destroyed four thousand churches, replacing them with
fourteen hundred mosques. In a few years they had extended
their rule a thousand miles east and west. In Syria,
as in Africa, their early successes were promoted in the
most effectual manner by treachery. Damascus was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
after a siege of a year. At the battle of Aiznadin, <small>A.D.</small> 633,
<span class="sidenote">The fall of Jerusalem.</span>
Kalid, "the Sword of God," defeated the army of Heraclius,
the Romans losing fifty thousand men; and this was soon
followed by the fall of the great cities Jerusalem,
Antioch, Aleppo, Tyre, Tripoli. On a red camel,
which carried a bag of corn and one of dates, a wooden
dish, and a leather water-bottle, the Khalif Omar came
from Medina to take formal possession of Jerusalem. He
entered the Holy City riding by the side of the Christian
patriarch Sophronius, whose capitulation showed that his
confidence in God was completely lost. The successor of
Mohammed and the Roman emperor both correctly judged
how important in the eyes of the nations was the possession
of Jerusalem. A belief that it would be a proof of the
authenticity of Mohammedanism led Omar to order the
Saracen troops to take it at any cost.</p>

<p>The conquest of Syria and the seizure of the Mediterranean
ports gave to the Arabs the command of the sea.
They soon took Rhodes and Cyprus. The battle of Cadesia
and sack of Ctesiphon, the metropolis of Persia, decided the
fate of that kingdom. Syria was thus completely reduced
under Omar, the second khalif; Persia under Othman, the
third.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabs become a learned nation.</div>

<p>If it be true that the Arabs burned the library of Alexandria,
there was at that time danger that their fanaticism
would lend itself to the Byzantine system; but it was only
for a moment that the khalifs fell into this evil
policy. They very soon became distinguished
patrons of learning. It has been said that they
overran the domains of science as quickly as they
overran the realms of their neighbours. It became customary
for the first dignities of the state to be held by men
distinguished for their erudition. Some of the maxims
current show how much literature was esteemed. "The
ink of the doctor is equally valuable with the blood of the
martyr." "Paradise is as much for him who has rightly
used the pen as for him who has fallen by the sword."
"The world is sustained by four things only: the learning
of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the good,
and the valour of the brave." Within twenty-five years
after the death of Mohammed, under Ali, the fourth khalif,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the patronage of learning had become a settled principle
of the Mohammedan system. Under the khalifs of Bagdad
this principle was thoroughly carried out. The cultivators
of mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and general literature
abounded in the court of Almansor, who invited all
philosophers, offering them his protection, whatever their
religious opinions might be. His successor, Alraschid, is
said never to have travelled without a retinue of a hundred
learned men. This great sovereign issued an edict that
no mosque should be built unless there was a school attached
to it. It was he who confided the superintendence of his
schools to the Nestorian Masué. His successor, Almaimon,
was brought up among Greek and Persian mathematicians,
philosophers, and physicians. They continued his associates
all his life. By these sovereigns the establishment
of libraries was incessantly prosecuted, and the collection
and copying of manuscripts properly organized. In all
the great cities schools abounded; in Alexandria there
were not less than twenty. As might be expected, this
could not take place without exciting the indignation of
the old fanatical party, who not only remonstrated with
Almaimon, but threatened him with the vengeance of God
for thus disturbing the faith of the people. However,
what had thus been commenced as a matter of profound
policy soon grew into a habit, and it was observed that
whenever an emir managed to make himself independent,
he forthwith opened academies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapidity of their intellectual development.</div>

<p>The Arabs furnish a striking illustration of the successive
phases of national life. They first come before
us as fetich worshippers, having their age of
credulity, their object of superstition being the
black stone in the temple at Mecca. They pass
through an age of inquiry, rendering possible the advent
of Mohammed. Then follows their age of faith, the blind
fanaticism of which quickly led them to overspread all
adjoining countries; and at last comes their period of
maturity, their age of reason. The striking feature of
their movement is the quickness with which they passed
through these successive phases, and the intensity of their
national life.</p>

<p>This singular rapidity of national life was favoured by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
very obvious circumstances. The long and desolating wars
between Heraclius and Chosroes had altogether destroyed
the mercantile relations of the Roman and Persian empires,
and had thrown the entire Oriental and African trade into
the hands of the Arabs. As a merchant Mohammed
himself makes his first appearance. The first we hear in
his history are the journeys he has made as the factor of
the wealthy Chadizah. In these expeditions with the
caravans to Damascus and other Syrian cities, he was
brought in contact with Jews and men of business, who,
from the nature of their pursuits, were of more enlarged
<span class="sidenote">Causes of the spread of Mohammedanism.</span>
views than mere Arab chieftains or the petty tradesmen of
Arab towns. Through such agency the first impetus was
given. As to the rapid success, its causes are in
like manner so plain as to take away all surprise.
It is no wonder that in fifty years, as Abderrahman
wrote to the khalif, not only had the tribute
from the entire north of Africa ceased, through the
population having become altogether Mohammedan, but
that the Moors boasted an Arab descent as their greatest
glory. For, besides the sectarian animosities on which I
have dwelt as facilitating the first conquest of the
Christians, and the dreadful shock that had been given by
the capture of the Holy City, Jerusalem, the insulting and
burning the sepulchre of our Saviour, and the carrying
away of his cross as a trophy by the Persians, there were
other very powerful causes. For many years the taxation
imposed by the Emperors of Constantinople on their
subjects in Asia and Africa had been not only excessive
and extortionate, but likewise complicated. This the
khalifs replaced by a simple well-defined tribute of far less
amount. Thus, in the case of Cyprus, the sum paid to the
khalif was only half of what it had been to the emperor;
and, indeed, the lower orders were never made to feel the
bitterness of conquest; the blows fell on the ecclesiastics,
not on the population, and between them there was but
little sympathy. In the eyes of the ignorant nations the
prestige of the patriarchs and bishops was utterly destroyed
by their detected helplessness to prevent the capture and
insult of the sacred places. On the payment of a trifling
sum the conqueror guaranteed to the Christian and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Jew absolute security for their worship. An equivalent
was given for a price. Religious freedom was bought with
money. Numerous instances might be given of the
scrupulous integrity with which the Arab commanders
complied with their part of the contract. The example set
by Omar on the steps of the Church of the Resurrection
was followed by Moawiyah, who actually rebuilt the
church of Edessa for his Christian subjects; and by Abdulmalek,
who, when he had commenced converting that of
Damascus into a mosque, forthwith desisted on finding
that the Christians were entitled to it by the terms of the
capitulation. If these things were done in the first fervour
of victory, the principles on which they depended were all
the more powerful after the Arabs had become tinctured
with Nestorian and Jewish influences, and were a learned
nation. It is related of Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed,
and the fourth successor in the khalifate, that he gave
himself up to letters. Among his sayings are recorded
such as these: "Eminence in science is the highest of
honours;" "He dies not who gives life to learning;" "The
greatest ornament of a man is erudition." When the
sovereign felt and expressed such sentiments, it was impossible
but that a liberal policy should prevail.</p>

<p>Besides these there were other incentives not less powerful.
To one whose faith sat lightly upon him, or who
valued it less than the tribute to be paid, it only required
the repetition of a short sentence acknowledging
the unity of God and the divine mission of the prophet,
and he forthwith became, though a captive or a slave, the
equal and friend of his conquerer. Doubtless many
thousands were under these circumstances carried away.
As respects the female sex, the Arab system was very far
from being oppressive; some have even asserted that "the
Christian women found in the seraglios a delightful
retreat." But above all, polygamy acted most effectually
in consolidating the conquests; the large families that
were raised&mdash;some are mentioned of more than one
hundred and eighty children&mdash;compressed into the course
of a few years events that would otherwise have taken
many generations for their accomplishment. These children
gloried in their Arab descent, and, being taught to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the language of their conquering fathers, became to all
intents and purposes Arabs. This diffusion of the language
was sometimes expedited by the edicts of the khalifs; thus
Alwalid I. prohibited the use of Greek, directing Arabic
to be employed in its stead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the arrest of Mohammedanism.</div>

<p>If thus without difficulty we recognise the causes which
led to the rapid diffusion of Arab power, we also without
difficulty recognise those which led to its check and
eventual dissolution. Arab conquest implied, from the
scale on which it was pursued, the forthgoing of
the whole nation. It could only be accomplished,
and in a temporary manner sustained, by an
excessive and incessant drain of the native Arab
population. That immobility, or, at best, that slow progress
the nation had for so many ages displayed, was at
an end, society was moved to its foundations, a fanatical
delirium possessed it, the greatest and boldest enterprises
were entered upon without hesitation, the wildest hopes
or passions of men might be speedily gratified, wealth and
beauty were the tangible rewards of valour in this life, to
say nothing of Paradise in the next. But such an outrush
of a nation in all directions implied the quick growth of
diverse interests and opposing policies. The necessary
<span class="sidenote">Necessary disintegration of the Arabian system.</span>
consequence of the Arab system was subdivision and
breaking up. The circumstances of its growth
rendered it certain that a decomposition would
take place in the political, and not, as was the
case of the ecclesiastical Roman system, in the
theological direction. All this is illustrated both in the
earlier and later Saracenic history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect on the low Arab class.</div>

<p>War makes a people run through its phases of existence
fast. It would have taken the Arabs many
thousand years to have advanced intellectually
as far as they did in a single century, had they,
as a nation, remained in profound peace. They did not
merely shake off that dead weight which clogs the movement
of a nation&mdash;its inert mass of common people; they
converted that mass into a living force. National progress
is the sum of individual progress; national immobility the
result of individual quiescence. Arabian life was run
through with rapidity, because an unrestrained career was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
opened to every man; and yet, quick as the movement was,
it manifested all those unavoidable phases through which,
whether its motion be swift or slow, humanity must
unavoidably pass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Review of the Koran.</div>

<p>Arabian influence, thus imposing itself on Africa and
Asia by military successes, and threatening even
Constantinople, rested essentially on an intellectual
basis, the value of which it is needful for us to
consider. The Koran, which is that basis, has exercised a
great control over the destinies of mankind, and still serves
as a rule of life to a very large portion of our race.
Considering the asserted origin of this book&mdash;indirectly
from God himself&mdash;we might justly expect that it would
<span class="sidenote">Its asserted homogeneousness and completeness.</span>
bear to be tried by any standard that man can apply, and
vindicate its truth and excellence in the ordeal of human
criticism. In our estimate of it we must constantly
bear in mind that it does not profess to
be successive revelations made at intervals of
ages and on various occasions, but a complete
production delivered to one man. We ought, therefore, to
look for universality, completeness, perfection. We might
expect that it would present us with just views of the
nature and position of this world in which, we live, and
<span class="sidenote">The characters it ought, therefore, to have presented.</span>
that, whether dealing with the spiritual or
the material, it would put to shame the most
celebrated productions of human genius, as the
magnificent mechanism of the heavens and the
beautiful living forms of the earth are superior to the vain
contrivances of man. Far in advance of all that has been
written by the sages of India, or the philosophers of Greece,
on points connected with the origin, nature, and destiny of
the universe, its dignity of conception and excellence of
expression should be in harmony with the greatness of the
subject with which it is concerned.</p>

<p>We might expect that it should propound with authority,
and definitively settle those all-important problems
which have exercised the mental powers of the ablest men
of Asia and Europe for so many centuries, and which are
at the foundation of all faith and all philosophy; that it
should distinctly tell us in unmistakable language what is
God, what is the world, what is the soul, and whether man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
has any criterion of truth; that it should explain to us
how evil can exist in a world the Maker of which is omnipotent
and altogether good; that it should reveal to us in
what the affairs of men are fixed by Destiny, in what by
free-will; that it should teach us whence we came, what is
the object of our continuing here, what is to become of us
hereafter. And, since a written work claiming a divine
origin must necessarily accredit itself even to those most
reluctant to receive it, its internal evidences becoming
stronger and not weaker with the strictness of the examination
to which they are submitted, it ought to deal
with those things that may be demonstrated by the
increasing knowledge and genius of man, anticipating
therein his conclusions. Such a work, noble as may be its
origin, must not refuse, but court the test of natural
philosophy, regarding it not as an antagonist, but as its
best support. As years pass on, and human science becomes
more exact and more comprehensive, its conclusions must
be found in unison therewith. When occasion arises, it
should furnish us at least the foreshadowings of the great
truths discovered by astronomy and geology, not offering
for them the wild fictions of earlier ages, inventions of the
infancy of man. It should tell us how suns and worlds are
distributed in infinite space, and how, in their successions,
they come forth in limitless time. It should say how far
the dominion of God is carried out by law, and what is the
point at which it is his pleasure to resort to his own good
providence or his arbitrary will. How grand the description
of this magnificent universe written by the Omnipotent
hand! Of man it should set forth his relations to other
living beings, his place among them, his privileges, and
responsibilities. It should not leave him to grope his way
through the vestiges of Greek philosophy, and to miss the
truth at last; but it should teach him wherein true knowledge
consists, anticipating the physical science, physical
power, and physical well-being of our own times, nay,
even unfolding for our benefit things that we are still
ignorant of. The discussion of subjects, so many and so
high, is not outside the scope of a work of such pretensions.
Its manner of dealing with them is the only criterion it
can offer of its authenticity to succeeding times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defects of the Koran.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Tried by such a standard, the Koran altogether fails.
In its philosophy it is incomparably inferior to the writings
of Chakia Mouni, the founder of Buddhism; in
its science it is absolutely worthless. On speculative
or doubtful things it is copious enough; but in the
exact, where a test can be applied to it, it totally fails.
Its astronomy, cosmogony, physiology, are so puerile as to
invite our mirth if the occasion did not forbid. They
belong to the old times of the world, the morning of human
knowledge. The earth is firmly balanced in its seat by
the weight of the mountains; the sky is supported over it
like a dome, and we are instructed in the wisdom and power
of God by being told to find a crack in it if we can.
Ranged in stories, seven in number, are the heavens, the
highest being the habitation of God, whose throne&mdash;for the
Koran does not reject Assyrian ideas&mdash;is sustained by
winged animal forms. The shooting-stars are pieces of
red-hot stone thrown by angels at impure spirits when
they approach too closely. Of God the Koran is full of
<span class="sidenote">Its God.</span>
praise, setting forth, often in not unworthy imagery, his
majesty. Though it bitterly denounces those who give
him any equals, and assures them that their sin
will never be forgiven; that in the judgment-day
they must answer the fearful question, "Where are my
companions about whom ye disputed?" though it inculcates
an absolute dependence on the mercy of God, and denounces
as criminals all those who make a merchandise of religion,
its ideas of the Deity are altogether anthropomorphic. He
is only a gigantic man living in a paradise. In this
respect, though exceptional passages might be cited, the
reader rises from a perusal of the 114 chapters of the Koran
with a final impression that they have given him low and
unworthy thoughts; nor is it surprising that one of the
Mohammedan sects reads it in such a way as to find no
difficulty in asserting that, "from the crown of the head
to the breast God is hollow, and from the breast downward
he is solid; that he has curled black hair, and roars like a
lion at every watch of the night." The unity asserted by
Mohammed is a unity in special contradistinction to the
Trinity of the Christians, and the doctrine of a divine
generation. Our Saviour is never called the Son of God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
but always the son of Mary. Throughout there is a perpetual
<span class="sidenote">Its views of man.</span>
acceptance of the delusion of the human
destiny of the universe. As to man, Mohammed
is diffuse enough respecting a future state, speaking with
clearness of a resurrection, the judgment-day, Paradise, the
torment of hell, the worm that never dies, the pains that
never end; but, with all this precise description of the
future, there are many errors as to the past. If modesty
did not render it unsuitable to speak of such topics here,
it might be shown how feeble is his physiology when he
has occasion to allude to the origin or generation of man.
He is hardly advanced beyond the ideas of Thales. One
who is so untrustworthy a guide as to things that are past,
cannot be very trustworthy as to events that are to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its literary inferiority compared with the Bible.</div>

<p>Of the literary execution of his work, it is, perhaps,
scarcely possible to judge fairly from a translation.
It is said to be the oldest prose composition
among the Arabs, by whom Mohammed's
boast of the unapproachable excellence of his
work is almost universally sustained; but it must not be
concealed that there have been among them very learned
men who have held it in light esteem. Its most celebrated
passages, as those on the nature of God, in Chapters II.,
XXIV., will bear no comparison with parallel ones in the
Psalms and Book of Job. In the narrative style, the story
of Joseph, in Chapter XII., compared with the same incidents
related in Genesis, shows a like inferiority. Mohammed
also adulterates his work with many Christian
legends, derived probably from the apocryphal gospel of
St. Barnabas; he mixes with many of his own inventions
the scripture account of the temptation of Adam, the
Deluge, Jonah and the whale, enriching the whole with
stories like the later Night Entertainments of his country,
the seven sleepers, Gog and Magog, and all the wonders of
genii, sorcery, and charms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of its surprising influence.</div>

<p>An impartial reader of the Koran may doubtless be surprised
that so feeble a production should serve its purpose
so well. But the theory of religion is one thing,
the practice another. The Koran abounds in
excellent moral suggestions and precepts; its
composition is so fragmentary that we cannot turn to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
single page without finding maxims of which all men must
approve. This fragmentary construction yields texts, and
mottoes, and rules complete in themselves, suitable for
common men in any of the incidents of life. There is a
perpetual insisting on the necessity of prayer, an inculcation
of mercy, almsgiving, justice, fasting, pilgrimage, and
other good works; institutions respecting conduct, both
social and domestic, debts, witnesses, marriage, children,
wine, and the like; above all, a constant stimulation to do
battle with the infidel and blasphemer. For life as it
passes in Asia, there is hardly a condition in which passages
from the Koran cannot be recalled suitable for
instruction, admonition, consolation, encouragement. To
the Asiatic and to the African, such devotional fragments
are of far more use than any sustained theological doctrine.
The mental constitution of Mohammed did not enable him
to handle important philosophical questions with the well-balanced
ability of the great Greek and Indian writers,
but he has never been surpassed in adaptation to the
spiritual wants of humble life, making even his fearful
fatalism administer thereto. A pitiless destiny is awaiting
us; yet the prophet is uncertain what it may be. "Unto
every nation a fixed time is decreed. Death will overtake
us even in lofty towers, but God only knoweth the place
in which a man shall die," After many an admonition of
the resurrection and the judgment-day, many a promise of
Paradise and threat of hell, he plaintively confesses, "I do
not know what will be done with you or me hereafter."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its true nature.</div>

<p>The Koran thus betrays a human, and not a very noble
intellectual origin. It does not, however, follow
that its author was, as is so often asserted, a
mere impostor. He reiterates again and again, I am
nothing more than a public preacher. He defends, not
always without acerbity, his work from those who, even in
his own life, stigmatized it as a confused heap of dreams,
or, what is worse, a forgery. He is not the only man who
has supposed himself to be the subject of supernatural and
divine communications, for this is a condition of disease
to which any one, by fasting and mental anxiety, may be
reduced.</p>

<p>In what I have thus said respecting a work held by so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
many millions of men as a revelation from God, I have
endeavoured to speak with respect, and yet with freedom,
constantly bearing in mind how deeply to this book Asia
and Africa are indebted for daily guidance, how deeply
Europe and America for the light of science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popular Mohammedanism.</div>

<p>As might be expected, the doctrines of the Koran have
received many fictitious additions and sectarian interpretations
in the course of ages. In the popular
superstition angels and genii largely figure.
The latter, being of a grosser fabric, eat, drink,
propagate their kind, are of two sorts, good and bad, and
existed long before men, having occupied the earth before
Adam. Immediately after death, two greenish, livid angels,
Monkir and Nekkar, examine every corpse as to its faith in
God and Mohammed; but the soul, having been separated
from the body by the angel of death, enters upon an intermediate
state, awaiting the resurrection. There is, however,
much diversity of opinion as to its precise disposal
before the judgment-day: some think that it hovers near
the grave; some, that it sinks into the well Zemzem;
some, that it retires into the trumpet of the Angel of the Resurrection;
the difficulty apparently being that any final
disposal before the day of judgment would be anticipatory
of that great event, if, indeed, it would not render it needless.
As to the resurrection, some believe it to be merely
spiritual, others corporeal; the latter asserting that the os
coccygis, or last bone of the spinal column, will serve, as
it were, as a germ, and that, vivified by a rain of forty
days, the body will sprout from it. Among the signs of
the approaching resurrection will be the rising of the sun
in the West. It will be ushered in by three blasts of a
trumpet: the first, known as the blast of consternation,
will shake the earth to its centre, and extinguish the sun
and stars; the second, the blast of extermination, will
annihilate all material things except Paradise, hell, and
the throne of God. Forty years subsequently, the angel
Israfil will sound the blast of resurrection. From his
trumpet there will be blown forth the countless myriads
of souls who have taken refuge therein or lain concealed.
The day of judgment has now come. The Koran contradicts
itself as to the length of this day; in one place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
making it a thousand, in another fifty thousand years.
Most Mohammedans incline to adopt the longer period,
since angels, genii, men, and animals have to be tried. As
to men, they will rise in their natural state, but naked;
white winged camels, with saddles of gold, awaiting the
saved. When the partition is made, the wicked will be
oppressed with an intolerable heat, caused by the sun, which,
having been called into existence again, will approach
within a mile, provoking a sweat to issue from them, and
this, according to their demerits, will immerse them from
the ankles to the mouth; but the righteous will be screened
by the shadow of the throne of God. The judge will be
seated in the clouds, the books open before him, and everything
in its turn called on to account for its deeds. For
greater dispatch, the angel Gabriel will hold forth his
balance, one scale of which hangs over Paradise and one
over hell. In these all works are weighed. As soon as
the sentence is delivered, the assembly, in a long file, will
pass over the bridge Al-Sirat. It is as sharp as the edge
of a sword, and laid over the mouth of hell. Mohammed
and his followers will successfully pass the perilous ordeal;
but the sinners, giddy with terror, will drop into the place
of torment. The blessed will receive their first taste of
happiness at a pond which is supplied by silver pipes from
the river Al-Cawthor. The soil of Paradise is of musk.
Its rivers tranquilly flow over pebbles of rubies and
emeralds. From tents of hollow pearls, the Houris, or
girls of Paradise, will come forth, attended by troops of
beautiful boys. Each Saint will have eighty thousand
servants and seventy-two girls. To these, some of the
more merciful Mussulmans add the wives they have had
upon earth; but the grimly orthodox assert that hell is
already nearly filled with women. How can it be otherwise
since they are not permitted to pray in a mosque
upon earth? I have not space to describe the silk brocades,
the green clothing, the soft carpets, the banquets, the perpetual
music and songs. From the glorified body all impurities
will escape, not as they did during life, but in a
fragrant perspiration of camphor and musk. No one will
complain I am weary; no one will say I am sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mohammedan sects.</div>

<p>From the contradictions, puerilities, and impossibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
indicated in the preceding paragraphs, it may be anticipated
that the faith of Mohammed has been broken into
many sects. Of such it is said that not less than
seventy-three may be numbered. Some, as the
Sonnites, are guided by traditions; some occupy themselves
with philosophical difficulties, the existence of evil in the
world, the attributes of God, absolute predestination and
eternal damnation, the invisibility and non-corporeality of
God, his capability of local motion: these and other such
topics furnish abundant opportunity for sectarian dispute.
As if to show how the essential principles of the Koran
may be departed from by those who still profess to be
guided by it, there are, among the Shiites, those who
believe that Ali was an incarnation of God; that he was
in existence before the creation of things; that he never
died, but ascended to heaven, and will return again in the
clouds to judge the world. But the great Mohammedan
philosophers, simply accepting the doctrine of the Oneness
of God as the only thing of which man can be certain, look
upon all the rest as idle fables, having, however, this
political use, that they furnish contention, and therefore
occupation to disputatious sectarians, and consolation to
illiterate minds.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">Effect of Mohammedanism on Christianity.</div>

<p>Thus settled on the north of Africa the lurid phantom
of the Arabian crescent, one horn reaching to the Bosphorus
and one pointing beyond the Pyrenees. For a
while it seemed that the portentous meteor would increase
to the full, and that all Europe would be enveloped.
Christianity had lost for ever the most interesting
countries over which her influence had once
spread, Africa, Egypt, Syria, the Holy Land,
Asia Minor, Spain. She was destined, in the
end, to lose in the same manner the metropolis of the East.
In exchange for these ancient and illustrious regions, she
fell back on Gaul, Germany, Britain, Scandinavia. In
those savage countries, what were there to be offered as
substitutes for the great capitals, illustrious in ecclesiastical
history, for ever illustrious in the records of the human
race&mdash;Carthage, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople?
It was an evil exchange. The labours, intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and physical, of which those cities had once been the
scene; the preaching, and penances, and prayers so lavishly
expended in them, had not produced the anticipated, the
asserted result. In theology and morality the people had
pursued a descending course. Patriotism was extinct.
They surrendered the state to preserve their sect; their
treason was rewarded by subjugation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflexions on the course of historic events.</div>

<p>From these melancholy events we may learn that the
principles on which the moral world is governed
are analogous to those which obtain in the
physical. It is not by incessant divine interpositions,
which produce breaches in the continuity
of historic action; it is not by miracles and
prodigies that the course of events is determined; but
affairs follow each other in the relation of cause and effect.
The maximum development of early Christianity coincided
with the boundaries of the Roman empire; the ecclesiastical
condition depended on the political, and, indeed, was
its direct consequence and issue. The loss of Africa and
Asia was, in like manner, connected with the Arabian
movement, though it would have been easy to prevent that
catastrophe, and to preserve those continents to the faith
by the smallest of those innumerable miracles of which
Church history is full, and which were often performed on
unimportant and obscure occasions. But not even one such
miracle was vouchsafed, though an angel might have
worthily descended. I know of no event in the history of
our race on which a thoughtful man may more profitably
meditate than on this loss of Africa and Asia. It may
remove from his mind many erroneous ideas, and lead
him to take a more elevated, a more philosophical, and,
therefore, more correct view of the course of earthly affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Age of Faith in the West.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the Age of Faith, in the East, I have now to turn to
the Age of Faith in the West. The former, as we have
seen, ended prematurely, through a metamorphosis

favourable circumstances, gradually completed its predestined
phases, and, after the lapse of many centuries,
passed into the Age of Reason.</p>

scarcely inferior are connected with Rome, "the Eternal

<div class="sidenote">Is essentially marked by the paganization of religion.</div>

<p>The Byzantine system, which, having originated in the
policy of an ambitious soldier struggling for
supreme power, and in the devices of ecclesiastics
intolerant of any competitors, had spread itself
all over the eastern and southern portions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Roman empire, and with its hatred of human knowledge
and degraded religious ideas and practices, had been
adopted at last even in Italy. Not by the Romans, for
they had ceased to exist, but by the medley of Goths and
half-breeds, the occupants of that peninsula. Gregory the
Great is the incarnation of the ideas of this debased
population. That evil system, so carefully nurtured by
Constantine and cherished by all the Oriental bishops, had
been cut down by the axe of the Vandal, the Persian, the
Arab, in its native seats, but the offshoot of it that had
been planted in Rome developed spontaneously with unexpected
luxuriance, and cast its dark shadow over Europe
for many centuries. He who knew what Christianity had
been in the apostolic days, might look with boundless
surprise on what was now ingrafted upon it, and was
passing under its name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the loss of Africa on events in Italy.</div>

<p>In the last chapter we have seen how, through the
Vandal invasion, Africa was lost to the empire&mdash;a
dire calamity, for, of all the provinces, it had
been the least expensive and the most productive;
it yielded men, money, and, what was
perhaps of more importance, corn for the use of Italy. A
sudden stoppage of the customary supply rendered impossible
the usual distributions in Rome, Ravenna, Milan.
A famine fell upon Italy, bringing in its train an
inevitable diminution of the population. To add to the
misfortunes, Attila, the King of the Huns, or, as he called
himself, "the Scourge of God," invaded the empire. The
battle of Chalons, the convulsive death-throe of the Roman
empire, arrested his career, <small>A.D.</small> 451.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall and pillage of Rome.</div>

<p>Four years after this event, through intrigues in the
imperial family, Genseric, the Vandal king, was
invited from Africa to Rome. The atrocities
which of old had been practised against Carthage under
the auspices of the senate were now avenged. For fourteen
days the Vandals sacked the city, perpetrating unheard-of
cruelties. Their ships, brought into the Tiber, enabled
them to accomplish their purpose of pillage far more effectually
than would have been possible by any land
expedition. The treasures of Rome, with multitudes of
noble captives, were transported to Carthage. In twenty-one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
years after this time, <small>A.D.</small> 476, the Western Empire
became extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the wars of Justinian.</div>

<p>Thus the treachery of the African Arians not only
brought the Vandals into the most important of all the
provinces, so far as Italy was concerned; it also
furnished an instrument for the ruin of Rome.
But hardly had the Emperor Justinian reconquered
Africa when he attempted the subjugation of the
Goths now holding possession of Italy. His general,
Belisarius, captured Rome, Dec. 10, <small>A.D.</small> 556. In the
military operations ensuing with Vitiges, Italy was devastated,
the population sank beneath the sword, pestilence,
famine. In all directions the glorious remains of antiquity
were destroyed; statues, as those of the Mole of Hadrian,
were thrown upon the besiegers of Rome. These operations
closed by the surrender of Vitiges to Belisarius at the
capture of Ravenna.</p>

<p>But, as soon as the military compression was withdrawn,
revolt broke out. Rome was retaken by the Goths; its
walls were razed; for forty days it was deserted by its
inhabitants, an emigration that in the end proved its ruin.
Belisarius, who had been sent back by the emperor, re-entered
it, but was too weak to retain it. During four
years Italy was ravaged by the Franks and the Goths. At
last Justinian sent the eunuch Narses with a well-appointed
army. The Ostrogothic monarchy was overthrown,
and the emperor governed Italy by his exarchs at
Ravenna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Debased ideas of the incoming Age of Faith.</div>

<p>But what was the cost of all this? We may reject the
statement previously made, that Italy lost fifteen millions
of inhabitants, on the ground that such computations were
beyond the ability of the survivors, but, from the asserted
number we may infer that there had been a horrible
catastrophe. In other directions the relics of civilization
were fast disappearing; the valley of the Danube had
relapsed into a barbarous state; the African shore had
become a wilderness; Italy a hideous desert;
and the necessary consequence of the extermination
of the native Italians by war, and their
replacement by barbarous adventurers, was the
falling of the sparse population of that peninsula into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
lower psychical state. It was ready for the materialized
religion that soon ensued. An indelible aspect was
stamped on the incoming Age of Faith. The East and the
West had equally displayed the imbecility of ecclesiastical
rule. Of both, the Holy City had fallen; Jerusalem had
been captured by the Persian and the Arab, Rome had
been sacked by the Vandal and the Goth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steady progress of the papacy to supremacy.</div>

<p>But, for the proper description of the course of affairs, I
must retrace my steps a little. In the important political
events coinciding with the death of Leo the Great, and the
constitution of the kingdom of Italy by the barbarian
Odoacer, <small>A.D.</small> 476-490, the bishops of Rome seem to have
taken but little interest. Doubtless, on one side,
they perceived the transitory nature of such
incidents, and, on the other, clearly saw for
themselves the road to lasting spiritual domination.
The Christians everywhere had long expressed a
total carelessness for the fate of old Rome; and in the
midst of her ruins the popes were incessantly occupied in
laying deep the foundations of their power. Though it
mattered little to them who was the temporal ruler of
Italy, they were vigilant and energetic in their relations
with their great competitors, the bishops of Constantinople
and Alexandria. It had become clear that Christendom
must have a head; and that headship, once definitely
settled, implied the eventual control over the temporal
power. Of all objects of human ambition, that headship
was best worth struggling for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its attitude toward the emperor.</div>

<p>Steadily pursuing every advantage as it arose, Rome
inexorably insisted that her decisions should be carried
out in Constantinople itself. This was the case especially
in the affair of Acacius, the bishop of that city, who, having
been admonished for his acts by Felix, the bishop of Rome,
was finally excommunicated. A difficulty arose as to the
manner in which the process should be served; but an
adventurous monk fastened it to the robe of Acacius as he
entered the church. Acacius, undismayed, proceeded with
his services, and, pausing deliberately, ordered the name
of Felix, the Bishop of Rome, to be struck from the roll of
bishops in communion with the East. Constantinople and
Rome thus mutually excommunicated one another. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in reference to this affair that Pope Gelasius, addressing
the emperor, says; "There are two powers which rule the
world, the imperial and pontifical. You are
the sovereign of the human race, but you bow
your neck to those who preside over things
divine. The priesthood is the greater of the two powers;
it has to render an account in the last day for the acts of
kings." This is not the language of a feeble ecclesiastic,
but of a pontiff who understands his power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gothic conquest gives the pope an Arian master.</div>

<p>The conquest of Italy by Theodoric, the Ostrogoth, <small>A.D.</small>
493, gave to the bishops of Rome an Arian sovereign,
and presented to the world the anomaly
of a heretic appointing God's vicar upon earth.
There was a contested election between two
rival candidates, whose factions, emulating the example of
the East, filled the city with murder. The Gothic monarch
ordered that he who had most suffrages, and had been
first consecrated, should be acknowledged. In this manner
Symmachus became pope.</p>

<p>Hormisdas, who succeeded Symmachus, renewed the
attempt to compel the Eastern emperor, Anastasius, to
accept the degradation of Acacius and his party, and to
enforce the assent of all his clergy thereto, but in vain.
On the accession of Justin to the imperial throne, Rome at
last carried her point; all her conditions were admitted;
the schism was ended in the humiliation of the Bishop of
Constantinople, it was said, through the orthodoxy of the
emperor. But very soon began to appear unmistakable
<span class="sidenote">The emperor and pope conspire against him.<br /><br />
The Gothic king detects them.</span>
indications that for this religious victory a temporal
equivalent had been given. Conspiracies were
detected in Rome against Theodoric, the Gothic
king; and rumours were whispered about that
the arms of Constantinople would before long
release Italy from the heretical yoke of the Arian. There
can be no doubt that Theodoric detected the
treason. It was an evil reward for his impartial
equity. At once he disarmed the population
of Rome. From being a merciful sovereign, he exhibited an
awful vengeance. It was in these transactions that
Boethius, the philosopher, and Symmachus, the senator,
fell victims to his wrath. The pope John himself was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
thrown into prison, and there miserably died. In his
remonstrances with Justin, the great barbarian monarch
displays sentiments far above his times, yet they were the
sentiments that had hitherto regulated his actions. "To
pretend to a dominion over the conscience is to usurp the
prerogative of God. By the nature of things, the power of
sovereigns is confined to political government. They have
no right of punishment but over those who disturb the
public peace. The most dangerous heresy is that of a
sovereign who separates himself from part of his subjects
because they believe not according to his belief."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conspiracy matures.</div>

<p>Theodoric had been but a few years dead&mdash;his soul was
seen by an orthodox hermit carried by devils into the
crater of the volcano of Lipari, which was considered to be
the opening into hell&mdash;when the invasion of
Italy by Justinian showed how well-founded his
suspicions had been. Rome was, however, very
far from receiving the advantages she had expected; the
inconceivable wickedness of Constantinople was brought
into Italy. Pope Sylverius, who was the son of Pope
Hormisdas, was deposed by Theodora, the emperor's wife.
<span class="sidenote">Subjugation of the pope by the emperor.</span>
This woman, once a common prostitute, sold the papacy to
Vigilius for two hundred pounds of gold. Her accomplice,
Antonina, the unprincipled wife of Belisarius, had
Sylverius stripped of his robes and habited as a
monk. He was subsequently banished to the
old convict island of Pandataria, and there died. Vigilius
embraced Eutychianism and, it was said, murdered one
of his secretaries, and caused his sister's son to be beaten
to death. He was made to feel what it is for a bishop to
be in the hands of an emperor; to taste of the cup so often
presented to prelates at Constantinople; to understand in
what estimation his sovereign held the vicar of God upon
earth. Compelled to go to that metropolis to embrace the
theological views which Justinian had put forth, thrice he
agreed to them, and thrice he recanted; he excommunicated
the Patriarch of Constantinople, and was excommunicated
by him. In his personal contests with the imperial officials,
they dragged him by his feet from a sanctuary with so much
violence that a part of the structure was pulled down upon
him; they confined him in a dungeon and fed him on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
bread and water. Eventually he died an outcast in Sicily.
The immediate effect of the conquest of Italy was the
reduction of the popes to the degraded condition of the
patriarchs of Constantinople. Such were the bitter fruits
of their treason to the Gothic king. The success of
Justinian's invasion was due to the clergy; in the ruin
they brought upon their country, and the relentless
tyranny they drew upon themselves, they had their
reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The paganization of religion proceeds.</div>

<p>In the midst of this desolation and degradation the Age
of Faith was gradually assuming distinctive lineaments in
Italy. Paganization, which had been patronized as a
matter of policy in the East, became a matter of
necessity in the West. To a man like Gregory
the Great, born in a position which enabled him
to examine things from a very general point of
view, it was clear that the psychical condition of the lower
social stratum demanded concessions in accordance with its
ideas. The belief of the thoughtful must be alloyed with
the superstition of the populace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division of the subjects to be treated of.</div>

<p>Accordingly, that was what actually occurred. For the
clear understanding of these events I shall have to speak,
1st, of the acts of Pope Gregory the Great, by
whom the ideas of the age were organized and
clothed in a dress suited to the requirements of
the times; 2d, of the relations which the papacy
soon assumed with the kings of France, by which the work
of Gregory was consolidated, upheld, and diffused all
over Europe. It adds not a little to the interest of these
things that the influences thus created have outlasted
their original causes, and, after the lapse of more than a
thousand years, though moss-covered and rotten, are a
stumbling-block to the progress of nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gregory the Great.</div>

<p>Gregory the Great was the grandson of Pope Felix.
His patrician parentage and conspicuous abilities
had attracted in early life the attention of the
Emperor Justin, by whom he was appointed prefect of
Rome. Withdrawn by the Church from the splendours of
secular life, he was sent, while yet a deacon, as nuncio to
Constantinople. Discharging the duties that had been
committed to him with singular ability and firmness, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
resumed the monastic life on his return, with daily increasing
reputation. Elected to the papacy by the clergy,
the senate, and people of Rome, <small>A.D.</small> 590, with well dissembled
resistance he implored the emperor to reject their
choice, and, on being refused, escaped from the city hidden
in a basket. It is related that the retreat in which he was
concealed was discovered by a celestial hovering light that
settled upon it, and revealed to the faithful their reluctant
pope. This was during a time of pestilence and famine.</p>

<p>Once made supreme pontiff, this austere monk in an
instant resumed the character he had displayed at Constantinople,
and exhibited the qualities of a great statesman.
He regulated the Roman liturgy, the calendar of
festivals, the order of processions, the fashions of sacerdotal
garments; he himself officiated in the canon of the mass,
devised many solemn and pompous rites, and invented the
chant known by his name. He established schools of music,
administered the Church revenues with precision and
justice, and set an example of almsgiving and charity;
for such was the misery of the times that even Roman
matrons had to accept the benevolence of the Church. He
authorized the alienation of Church property for the
redemption of slaves, laymen as well as ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>An insubordinate clergy and a dissolute populace quickly
felt the hand that now held the reins. He sedulously
watched the inferior pastors, dealing out justice to them,
and punishing all who offended with rigorous severity.
He compelled the Italian bishops to acknowledge him as
their metropolitan. He extended his influence to Greece;
prohibited simony in Gaul; received into the bosom of the
Church Spain, now renouncing her Arianism; sent out
missionaries to Britain, and converted the pagans of that
country; extirpated heathenism from Sardinia; resisted
John, the Patriarch of Constantinople, who had dared to
take the title of universal bishop; exposed to the emperor
the ruin occasioned by the pride, ambition, and wickedness
of the clergy, and withstood him on the question of the
law prohibiting soldiers from becoming monks. It was not
in the nature of such a man to decline the regulation of
political affairs; he nominated tribunes, and directed the
operations of troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His superstition.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
No one can shake off the system that has given him
power; no one can free himself from the tincture of the
times of which he is the representative. Though
in so many respects Gregory was far in advance
of his age, he was at once insincere and profoundly superstitious.
With more than Byzantine hatred he detested
human knowledge. His oft-expressed belief that the end
of the world was at hand was perpetually contradicted by
his acts, which were ceaselessly directed to the foundation
<span class="sidenote">He materializes religion.</span>
of a future papal empire. Under him was sanctified that
mythologic Christianity destined to become the
religion of Europe for many subsequent centuries,
and which adopted the adoration of the Virgin by images
and pictures; the efficacy of the remains of martyrs and
relics; stupendous miracles wrought at the shrines of
saints; the perpetual interventions of angels and devils in
sublunary affairs; the truth of legends far surpassing in
romantic improbability the stories of Greek mythology;
the localization of heaven a few miles above the air, and of
hell in the bowels of the earth, with its portal in the crater
of Lipari. Gregory himself was a sincere believer in
miracles, ghosts, and the resurrection of many persons
from the grave, but who, alas! had brought no tidings of
the secret wonders of that land of deepest shade. He made
these wild fancies the actual, the daily, the practical
religion of Europe. Participating in the ecclesiastical
<span class="sidenote">His hatred of learning,<br /><br />
and expulsion of classical authors.</span>
hatred of human learning, and insisting on the maxim
that "Ignorance is the mother of devotion," he
expelled from Rome all mathematical studies,
and burned the Palatine library founded by Augustus
Cæsar. It was valuable for the many rare manuscripts it
contained. He forbade the study of the classics, mutilated
statues, and destroyed temples. He hated the
very relics of classical genius; pursued with vindictive
fanaticism the writings of Livy, against
whom he was specially excited. It has truly been said
that "he was as inveterate an enemy to learning as
ever lived;" that "no lucid ray ever beamed on his superstitious
soul." He boasted that his own works were
written without regard to the rules of grammar, and
censured the crime of a priest who had taught that subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
It was his aim to substitute for the heathen writings others
which he thought less dangerous to orthodoxy; and so
well did he succeed in rooting out of Italy her illustrious
pagan authors, that when one of his successors, Paul I., sent
to Pepin of France "what books he could find," they were
"an antiphonal, a grammar, and the works of Dionysius
the Areopagite." He was the very incarnation of the
Byzantine principle of ignorance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual preparation for the debasement of religion.</div>

<p>If thus the misfortunes that had fallen on Italy had
given her a base population, whose wants could only be
met by a paganized religion, the more fortunate
classes all over the empire had long been tending
in the same direction. Whoever will examine
the progress of Christian society from the earlier
ages, will find that there could be no other result than a
repudiation of solid learning and an alliance with art. We
have only to compare the poverty and plainness of the first
disciples with the extravagance reached in a few generations.
<span class="sidenote">Corruption of Christianity.</span>
Cyprian complains of the covetousness, pride,
luxury, and worldly-mindedness of Christians, even of the
clergy and confessors. Some made no scruple
to contract matrimony with heathens. Clement
of Alexandria bitterly inveighs against "the vices of
an opulent and luxurious Christian community&mdash;splendid
dresses, gold and silver vessels, rich banquets, gilded
litters and chariots, and private baths. The ladies kept
Indian birds, Median peacocks, monkeys, and Maltese
dogs, instead of maintaining widows and orphans; the men
had multitudes of slaves." The dipping three times at
baptism, the tasting of honey and milk, the oblations for
the dead, the signing of the cross on the forehead on
putting on the clothes or the shoes, or lighting a candle,
which Tertullian imputes to tradition without the authority
of Scripture, foreshadowed a thousand pagan observances
soon to be introduced. As time passed on, so far from the
state of things improving, it became worse. Not only
among the frivolous class, but even among historic personages,
there was a hankering after the ceremonies of the
departed creed, a lingering attachment to the old rites,
and, perhaps, a religious indifference to the new. To the
age of Justinian these remarks strikingly apply. Boethius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
was, at the best, only a pagan philosopher; Tribonian,
the great lawyer, the author of the Justinian Code, was
suspected of being an atheist.</p>

<p>In the East, the splendour of the episcopal establishments
extorted admiration even from those who were familiar
with the imperial court. The well-ordered trains of
attendants and the magnificent banquets in the bishops'
palaces are particularly praised. Extravagant views of
the pre-eminent value of celibacy had long been held
among the more devout, who conceded a reluctant admission
<span class="sidenote">Episcopal splendour and wickedness.</span>
even for marriage itself. "I praise the married state,
but chiefly for this, that it provides virgins," had been
the more than doubtful encomium of St. Jerome. Among
the clergy, who under the force of this growing
sentiment found it advisable to refrain from
marriage, it had become customary, as we learn
from the enactments and denunciations against the practice,
to live with "sub-introduced women," as they were called.
<span class="sidenote">Paganisms of Christianity.</span>
These passed as sisters of the priests, the correctness of
whose taste was often exemplified by the remarkable
beauty of their sinful partners. A law of
Honorius put an end to this iniquity. The
children arising from these associations do not appear to
have occasioned any extraordinary scandal. At weddings
it was still the custom to sing hymns to Venus. The
cultivation of music at a very early period attracted the
attention of many of the great ecclesiastics&mdash;Paul of
Samosata, Arius, Chrysostom. In the first congregations
<span class="sidenote">It allies itself to art,</span>
probably all the worshippers joined in the hymns and
psalmody. By degrees, however, more skilful
performers had been introduced, and the chorus
of the Greek tragedy made available under the form of
antiphonal singing. The Ambrosian chant was eventually
exchanged for the noble Roman chant of Gregory the
Great, which has been truly characterised as the foundation
of all that is grand and elevated in modern music.</p>

<p>With the devastation that Italy had suffered the Latin
language was becoming extinct. But Roman literature
had never been converted to Christianity. Of the best
writers among the Fathers, not one was a Roman; all
were provincials. The literary basis was the Hebrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Scriptures and the New Testament, the poetical imagery
being, for the most part, borrowed from the prophets. In
historical compositions there was a want of fair dealing
<span class="sidenote">and rejects learning.</span>
and truthfulness almost incredible to us; thus Eusebius
naïvely avows that in his history he shall omit whatever
might tend to the discredit of the Church, and
magnify whatever might conduce to her glory.
The same principle was carried out in numberless legends,
many of them deliberate forgeries, the amazing credulity
of the times yielding to them full credit, no matter how
much they might outrage common sense. But what else
was to be expected of generations who could believe that
the tracks of Pharaoh's chariot-wheels were still impressed
on the sands of the Red Sea, and could not be obliterated
either by the winds or the waves? He who ventured to
offend the public taste for these idle fables brought down
upon himself the wrath of society, and was branded as an
infidel. In the interpretation of the Scriptures, and,
indeed, in all commentaries on authors of repute, there was
a constant indulgence in fanciful mystification and the
detection of concealed meanings, in the extracting of which
an amusing degree of ingenuity and industry was often
shown; but these hermeneutical writings, as well as the
polemical, are tedious beyond endurance; with regard to
the latter, the energy of their vindictive violence is not
sufficient to redeem them from contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Painting and sculpture.</div>

<p>The relation of the Church to the sister arts, painting
and sculpture, was doubtless fairly indicated at
a subsequent time by the second Council of
Nicea, <small>A.D.</small> 787; their superstitious use had been resumed.
Sculpture has, however, never forgotten the preference
that was shown to her sister. To this day she is a pagan,
emulating in this the example of the noblest of the sciences,
Astronomy, who bears in mind the great insults she has
received from the Church, and tolerates the name of no
saint in the visible heavens; the new worlds she discovers
are dedicated to Uranus, or Neptune, or other Olympian
divinities. Among the ecclesiastics there had always been
many, occasionally some of eminence, who set their faces
against the connexion of worship with art; thus Tertullian
of old had manifested his displeasure against Hermogenes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
on account of the two deadly sins into which he had fallen,
painting and marriage; but Gnostic Christianity had
approved, as Roman Christianity was now to approve, of
their union. To the Gnostics we owe the earliest examples
of our sacred images. The countenance of our Saviour,
along with those of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, appears
on some of their engraved gems and seals. Among the
earlier fathers&mdash;Justin Martyn and Tertullian&mdash;there was
an impression that the personal appearance of our Lord
was ungainly; that he was short of stature; and, at a
later period Cyril says, mean of aspect "even beyond the
<span class="sidenote">Adopts a typical model of the Saviour,</span>
ordinary race of men." But these unsuitable delineations
were generally corrected in the fourth century,
it being then recognised that God could not dwell
in a humble form or low stature. The model
eventually received was perhaps that described in the
spurious epistle of Lentulus to the Roman senate: "He
was a man of tall and well-proportioned form; his countenance
severe and impressive, so as to move the beholders
at once with love and awe. His hair was of an amber
colour, reaching to his ears with no radiation, and standing
up from his ears clustering and bright, and flowing
down over his shoulders, parted on the top according to
the fashion of the Nazarenes. The brow high and open;
the complexion clear, with a delicate tinge of red; the
aspect frank and pleasing; the nose and mouth finely
formed; the beard thick, parted, and of the colour of the
hair; the eyes blue, and exceedingly bright." Subsequently
the oval countenance assumed an air of melancholy,
which, though eminently suggestive, can hardly be considered
as the type of manly beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of the Virgin.</div>

<p>At first the cross was without any adornment; it next
had a lamb at the foot; and eventually became the crucifix,
sanctified with the form of the dying Saviour. Of the Virgin
Mary, destined in later times to furnish so many
beautiful types of female loveliness, the earliest
representations are veiled. The Egyptian sculptors had
thus depicted Isis; the first form of the Virgin and child
was the counterpart of Isis and Horus. St. Augustine says
her countenance was unknown; there appears, however,
to have been a very early Christian tradition that in complexion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
she was a brunette. Adventurous artists by
degrees removed the veil, and next to the mere countenance
added a full-grown figure like that of a dignified
Roman matron; then grouped her with the divine child,
the wise men, and other suggestions of Scripture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consolidation of papal power in the West.</div>

<p>While thus the papacy was preparing for an alliance
with art, it did not forget to avail itself of the vast
advantages within its reach by interfering in domestic
life&mdash;an interference which the social demoralization of
the time more than ever permitted. A prodigious step in
power was made by assuming the cognizance of marriage,
and the determination of the numberless questions connected
with it. Once having discovered the
influence thus gained, the papacy never surrendered
it; some of the most important events
in later history have been determined by its
action in this matter. Perhaps even a greater power
accrued from its assumption of the cognizance of wills,
and of questions respecting the testamentary disposal of
property. Though in many respects, at the time we are
now considering, the papacy had separated itself from
morality, had become united to monachism, and was preparing
for a future alliance with political influences and
military power; though its indignation and censures were
less against personal wickedness than heresy of opinion,
toward which it was inexorable and remorseless, a good
effect arose from these assumptions upon domestic life,
particularly as regards the elevation of the female sex.
<span class="sidenote">Roman Church anthropomorphized,<br /><br />
and necessarily becoming intolerant.</span>
The power thus arising was re-enforced by a continually-increasing
rigour in the application of penitential punishments.
As in the course of years the intellectual
basis on which that power rested became more
doubtful, and therefore more open to attack, the
papacy became more sensitive and more exacting.
Pushed on by the influence of the lower population, it fell
into the depths of anthropomorphism, asserting for the
Virgin and the saints such attributes as omniscience,
omnipresence, omnipotence. Everywhere
present, they could always listen to
prayer, and, if necessary, control or arrest the course of
Nature. As it was certain that such doctrines must in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the end be overthrown, the inevitable day was put off
by an instant and vindictive repression of any want
of conformity. Despotism in the State and despotism in
the Church were upheld by despotism over thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the alliance of the papacy and France.</div>

<p>From the acts of Pope Gregory the Great, and his
organization of the ideas of his age, the paganization of
religion in Italy and its alliance with art, I
have now to turn to the second topic to which
this chapter is devoted&mdash;the relations assumed
by the papacy with the kings of France, by
which the work of Gregory was consolidated and upheld,
and diffused all over Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military results of the Arabian wars.</div>

<p>The armies of the Saracens had wrested from Christendom
the western, southern, and eastern countries
of the Mediterranean; their fleets dominated in
that sea. Ecclesiastical policy had undergone
a revolution. Carthage, Alexandria, Jerusalem,
Antioch, had disappeared from the Christian system; their
bishops had passed away. Alone, of the great episcopal
seats, Constantinople and Rome were left. To all human
appearance, their fall seemed to be only a question of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Independence of the pope.</div>

<p>The disputes of the Bishop of Rome with his African
and Asiatic rivals had thus come to an untimely end.
With them nothing more remained to be done;
his communications with the emperor at Constantinople
were at the sufferance of the Mohammedan
navies. The imperial power was paralysed. The pope
was forced by events into isolation; he converted it into
independence.</p>

<p>But independence! how was that to be asserted and
maintained. In Italy itself the Lombards seemed to be
firmly seated, but they were Arian heretics. Their
presence and power were incompatible with his. Already,
in a political sense, he was at their mercy.</p>

<p>One movement alone was open to him; and, whether he
rightly understood his position or not, the stress of events
forced him to make it. It was an alliance with the Franks,
who had successfully resisted the Mohammedan power, and
who were orthodox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions of his alliance with the Franks.</div>

<p>An ambitious Frank officer had resolved to deprive his
sovereign of the crown if the pope would sanctify the deed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
They came to an understanding. The usurpation was
consummated by the one and consecrated by the other. It
was then the interest of the intrusive line of
monarchs to magnify their Italian confederate.
In the spread of Roman principles lay the consolidation
of the new Frankish power. It became
desirable to compel the ignorant German tribes to acknowledge
in the pope the vicegerent of God, even though the
sword must be applied to them for that purpose for thirty
years.</p>

<p>The pope revolted against his Byzantine sovereign on
the question of images; but that was a fictitious issue.
He did not revolt against his new ally, who fell into the
same heresy. He broke away from a weak and cruel
master, and attached himself on terms of equality to a
confederate. But from the first his eventual ascendancy
was assured. The representative of a system which is
immortal must finally gain supremacy over individuals
and families, who must die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conversion of Europe.</div>

<p>Though we cannot undervalue the labours of the monks,
who had already nominally brought many portions of
Europe to Christianity, the passage of the centre
of the Continent to its Age of Faith, was, in an
enlarged political sense, the true issue of the
empire of the Franks. The fiat of Charlemagne put a
stamp upon it which it bears to this day. He converted an
ecclesiastical fiction into a political fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three points for consideration.</div>

<p>To understand this important event, it is necessary to
describe, 1st, the psychical state of Central
Europe; 2nd, the position of the pontiff and his
compact with the Franks. It is also necessary
to determine the actual religious value of the system he
represents, and this is best done through, 3rd, the biography
of the popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The psychical change of Europe.</div>

<p>1st. As with the Arabs, so with the barbarians of
Europe. They pass from their Age of Credulity
to their Age of Faith without dwelling long in
the intermediate state of Inquiry. An age of
inquiry implies self-investigation, and the absence of an
authoritative teacher. But the Arabs had had the Nestorians
and the Jews, and to the Germans the lessons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the monk were impressively enforced by the convincing
argument of the sword of Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Labours and successes of the monks.</div>

<p>The military invasions of the south by the barbarians
were retaliated by missionary invasions of the north. The
aim of the former was to conquer, that of their
antagonists to convert, if antagonists those can
be called who sought to turn them from their
evil ways. The monk penetrated through their most
gloomy forests unarmed and defenceless; he found his way
alone to their fortresses. Nothing touches the heart of a
savage so profoundly as the greatness of silent courage.
<span class="sidenote">Influence of devout women.</span>
Among the captives taken from the south in war were
often high-born women of great beauty and
purity of mind, and sometimes even bishops,
who, true to their religious principles, did not
fail to exert a happy and a holy influence on the tribes
among whom their lot was cast. One after another the
various nations submitted: the Vandals and Gepidæ in the
fourth century; the Goths somewhat earlier; the Franks
at the end of the fifth; the Alemanni and Lombards at
<span class="sidenote">Conversion of Europe.</span>
the beginning of the sixth; the Bavarians, Hessians,
and Thuringians in the seventh and
eighth. Of these, all embraced the Arian form except the
Franks, who were converted by the Catholic clergy. In
truth, however, these nations were only Christianized
upon the surface, their conversion being indicated by little
more than their making the sign of the cross. In all
these movements women exercised an extraordinary
influence: thus Clotilda, the Queen of the Franks, brought
over to the faith her husband Clovis. Bertha, the Queen
of Kent, and Gisella, the Queen of Hungary, led the way
in their respective countries; and under similar influences
were converted the Duke of Poland and the Czar Jarislaus.
To women Europe is thus greatly indebted, though the
forms of religion at the first were nothing more than
the creed and the Lord's prayer. It has been truly
said that for these conversions three conditions were
necessary&mdash;a devout female of the court, a national calamity,
and a monk. As to the people, they seem to have
followed the example of their rulers in blind subserviency,
altogether careless as to what the required faith might be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
The conversion of the ruler is naïvely taken by historians
as the conversion of the whole people. As might be
expected, a faith so lightly assumed at the will or whim of
the sovereign was often as lightly cast aside; thus the
Swedes, Bohemians, and Hungarians relapsed into idolatry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversion of England.</div>

<p>Among such apostasies it is interesting to recall that of
the inhabitants of Britain, to whom Christianity
was first introduced by the Roman legions, and
who might boast in Constantine the Great, and his mother
Helena, if they were really natives of that country, that
they had exercised no little influence on the religion of the
world. The biography of Pelagius shows with what
acuteness theological doctrines were considered in those
remote regions; but, after the decline of Roman affairs,
this promising state of things was destroyed, and the
clergy driven by the pagan invaders to the inaccessible
parts of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. The sight of some
English children exposed for sale in the slave-market at
Rome suggested to Gregory the Great the attempt of reconverting
the island. On his assuming the pontificate
he commissioned the monk Augustine for that purpose; and
after the usual exertion of female influence in the court of
King Ethelbert by Bertha, his Frankish princess, and the
usual vicissitudes of backsliding, the faith gradually won
its way throughout the whole country. A little opposition
occurred on the part of the ancient clergy, who retained in
their fastnesses the traditions of the old times, particularly
in regard to Easter. But this at length disappeared; an
intercourse sprang up with Rome, and it became common
for the clergy and wealthy nobles to visit that city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish and British missionaries.</div>

<p>Displaying the same noble quality which in our own
times characterises it, British Christianity did not fail to
exert a proselytizing spirit. As, at the end of
the sixth century, Columban, an Irish monk of
Banchor, had gone forth as a missionary, passing
through France, Switzerland, and beyond the confines of
the ancient Roman empire, so about a century later
Boniface, an Englishman of Devonshire, repaired to
Germany, under a recommendation from the pope and
Charles Martel, and laboured among the Hessians and
Saxons, cutting down their sacred oaks, overturning their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
altars, erecting churches, founding bishoprics, and gaining
at last, from the hands of the savages, the crown of
martyrdom. In the affinity of their language to those of
the countries to which they went, these missionaries from
the West found a very great advantage.</p>

<p>It is the glory of Pope Formosus, the same whose body
underwent a posthumous trial, that he converted the
Bulgarians, a people who came from the banks of the
Volga. The fact that this event was brought about by a
picture representing the judgment-day shows on what
trifling circumstances these successes turned. The Slavians
were converted by Greek missionaries, and for them the
monk Cyril invented an alphabet, as Ulphilas had done for
the Goths. The predatory Normans, who plundered the
churches in their forays, embraced Christianity on settling
in Normandy, as the Goths, in like circumstances, had
elsewhere done. The Scandinavians were converted by St.
Anschar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of Charlemagne on these events.</div>

<p>Thus, partly by the preaching of missionaries, partly by
the example of monks, partly by the influence of females,
partly by the sword of the Frankish sovereigns, partly by
the great name of Rome, Europe was at last nominally
converted. The so-called religious wars of Charlemagne,
which lasted more than thirty years, and which
were attended by the atrocities always incident
to such undertakings, were doubtless as much, so
far as he was concerned, of a political as of a
theological nature. They were the embodiment of the
understanding that had been made with Rome by Pepin.
Charlemagne clearly comprehended the position and functions
of the Church; he never suffered it to intrude unduly
on the state. Regarding it as furnishing a bond for
uniting not only the various nations and tribes of his
empire, but even families and individuals together, he ever
extended to it a wise and liberal protection. His mental
condition prevented him from applying its doctrines to the
regulation of his own life, which was often blemished by
acts of violence and immorality. From the point of view
he occupied, he doubtless was led to the conclusion that
the maxims of religion are intended for the edification and
comfort of those who occupy a humbler sphere, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
for a prince it is only necessary to maintain appropriate
political relations with the Church. To him baptism was
the sign, not of salvation, but of the subjugation of people;
and the foundation of churches and monasteries, the institution
of bishoprics, and increase of the clergy, a more
trustworthy means of government than military establishments.
A priest must necessarily lean on him for support,
a lieutenant might revolt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflex action of converted Europe.</div>

<p>If thus Europe, by its conversion, received from Rome
an immense benefit, it repaid the obligation at length by
infusing into Latin Christianity what was sadly needed&mdash;a
higher moral tone. Earnestness is the attribute of
savage life. That divorce between morality and
faith which the southern nations had experienced
was not possible among these converts. If, by
communicating many of their barbarous and pagan conceptions
to the Latin faith, they gave it a tendency to
develop itself in an idolatrous form, their influence was not
one of unmitigated evil, for while they lowered the
standard of public belief, they elevated that of private life.
In truth, the contamination they imparted is often over-rated.
The infusion of paganism into religion was far
more due to the people of the classical countries. The
inhabitants of Italy and Greece were never really alienated
from the idolatries of the old times. At the best, they
were only Christianized on the surface. With many other
mythological practices, they forced image-worship on the
clergy. But Charlemagne, who, in this respect, may be
looked upon as a true representative of Frankish and
German sentiment, totally disapproved of that idolatry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conspiracy of the papacy and the Franks.</div>

<p>2nd. From this consideration of the psychical
revolution that had occurred in Central Europe,
I turn to an investigation of the position of the
papacy and its compact with the Franks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Position of the Franks and Saracens.</div>

<p>Scarcely had the Arabs consolidated their conquest of
Africa when they passed into Spain, and quickly, as will
be related in a subsequent chapter, subjugating
that country, prepared to overwhelm Europe.
It was their ambition and their threat to preach
the unity of God in Rome. They reached the centre of
France, but were beaten in the great battle of Tours by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Charles Martel, the Duke of the Franks, <small>A.D.</small> 732. That
battle fixed the religious destiny of Europe. The Saracens
did not, however, give up their attempt. Three years
afterward they returned into Provence, and Charles was
himself repulsed. But by this time their power had
expanded too extensively for consolidation. It was already
giving unmistakable tokens of decomposition. Scarcely,
indeed, had Musa, the conqueror of Spain, succeeded in his
expedition, when he was arrested at the head of his army,
and ordered to give an account of his doings at Damascus.
It was the occurrence of such disputes among the Saracens
in Spain that constituted the true check to their conquest
of France. Charles Martel had permitted Chilperic II.
and Thierry IV. to retain the title of king; but his foresight
of approaching events seems to be indicated by the
<span class="sidenote">Relations of Charles Martel to the Church.</span>
circumstance that after the death of the latter he abstained
from appointing any successor. He died <small>A.D.</small> 741,
leaving a memory detested by the Church of his
own country on account of his having been
obliged to appropriate from its property sufficient for the
payment of his army. He had taken a tithe from the
revenues of the churches and convents for that purpose.
The ignorant clergy, alive only to their present temporal
interests, and not appreciating the great salvation he had
wrought out for them, could never forgive him. Their
inconceivable greed could not bear to be taxed even in its
own defence. "It is because Prince Charles," says the
Council of Kiersi to one of his descendants, "was the first
of all the kings and princes of the Franks who separated
and dismembered the goods of the Church; it is for that
sole cause that he is eternally damned. We know, indeed,
that St. Eucherius, Bishop of Orleans, being in prayer,
was carried up into the world of spirits, and that among
the things which the Lord showed to him, he beheld
Charles tormented in the lowest depths of hell. The angel
who conducted him, being interrogated on this matter,
answered him that, in the judgment to come, the soul and
body of him who has taken, or who has divided the goods
of the Church, shall be delivered over, even before the end
of the world, to eternal torments by the sentence of the
saints, who shall sit together with the Lord to judge him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
This act of sacrilege shall add to his own sins the accumulated
sins of all those who thought that they had purchased
their redemption by giving for the love of God their goods
to holy places, to the lights of divine worship, and to the
alms of the servants of Christ." This amusing but instructive
quotation strikingly shows how quickly the
semi barbarian Frankish clergy had caught the methods of
Rome in the defence of temporal possessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The epoch of Pepin.</div>

<p>Pepin, the son of Charles Martel, introduces us to an
epoch and a policy resembling in many respects
that of Constantine the Great; for he saw that
by an alliance with the Church it would be possible for
him to displace his sovereign and attain to kingly power.
A thorough understanding was entered upon between
Pepin and the pope. Each had his needs. One wanted
the crown of France, the other liberation from Constantinople
and the Lombards. Pepin commenced by enriching
the clergy with immense gifts, and assigning to the bishops
seats in the assembly of the nation. In thus consolidating
<span class="sidenote">His conspiracy with the pope.</span>
ecclesiastical power he occasioned a great social revolution,
as was manifested by the introduction of the Latin and
the disuse of the Frankic on those occasions, and by the
transmuting of military reviews into theological
assemblies. Meantime Pope Zachary, on his
part, made ready to accomplish his engagement,
the chaplain of Pepin being the intermedium of negotiation.
On the demand being formally made, the pope decided
that "he should be king who really possessed the royal
power." Hereupon, in March, <small>A.D.</small> 752, Pepin caused
himself to be raised by his soldiers on a buckler and proclaimed
King of the Franks. To give solemnity to the
event, he was anointed by the bishops with oil. The
deposed king, Childeric III., was shut up in the convent of
St. Omer. Next year Pope Stephen III., driven to extremity,
applied to Pepin for assistance against the Lombards. It
was during these transactions that he fell upon the device
of enforcing his demand by a letter which he feigned
had been written by St. Peter to the Franks. And now,
visiting France, the pope, as an earnest of his friendship,
and as the token of his completion of the contract, in the
monastery of St. Denis, placed, with his own hands, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
diadem on Pepin's brow, and anointed him, his wife, and
<span class="sidenote">Its results.</span>
children, with "the holy oil," thereby reviving the Jewish
system of creating kings by anointment, and imparting to
his confederate "a divine right." Pepin now
finally defeated the Lombards, and assigned a
part of the conquered territory to the pope. Thus, by a
successful soldier, two important events had been accomplished&mdash;a
revolution in France, attended by a change of
dynasty, and a revolution in Christendom&mdash;the Bishop of
Rome had become a temporal sovereign. To the hilt of
the sword of France the keys of St. Peter were henceforth
so firmly bound that, though there have been great kings,
and conquerors, and statesmen who have wielded that
sword, not one to this day has been able, though many
have desired, to wrench the encumbrance away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reign of Charlemagne.</div>

<p>Charlemagne, on succeeding his father Pepin, thoroughly
developed his policy. At the urgent entreaty of
Pope Stephen III. he entered Italy, subjugated
the Lombards, and united the crown of Lombardy to
that of France. Upon the pagan Saxons burning the
church of Deventer, he commenced a war with them which
lasted thirty-three years, and ended in their compulsory
Christianization. As the circle of his power extended, he
everywhere founded churches and established bishoprics,
enriching them with territorial possessions. To the petty
sovereigns, as they successively succumbed, he permitted
the title of counts. True to his own and his father's
understanding with the pope, he invariably insisted on
baptism as the sign of submission, punishing with appalling
barbarity any resistance, as on the occasion of the
revolt, <small>A.D.</small> 782, when, in cold blood, he beheaded in one
day 4500 persons at Verden. Under such circumstances,
it is not to be wondered at that clerical influence extended
so fast; yet, rapid as was its development, the power of
Charlemagne was more so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is crowned Emperor of the West,</div>

<p>In the church of St. Peter at Rome, on Christmas-day,
<small>A.D.</small> 800, Pope Leo III., after the celebration of
the holy mysteries, suddenly placed on the head
of Charlemagne a diadem, amid the acclamations
of the people, "Long life and victory to Charles, the
most pious Augustus, crowned by God, the great and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
pacific Emperor of the Romans." His head and body were
anointed with the holy oil, and, as was done in the case of
the Cæsars, the pontiff himself saluted or adored him. In
the coronation oath Charlemagne promised to maintain the
privileges of the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and carries out his compact with the papacy.</div>

<p>The noble title of "Emperor of the West" was not
inappropriate, for Charlemagne ruled in France, Spain,
Italy, Germany, Hungary. An inferior dignity
would not have been equal to his deserts. His
princely munificence to St. Peter was worthy of
the great occasion, and even in his minor acts
he exhibited a just appreciation of his obligations to the
apostle. He proceeded to make in his dominions such
changes in the Church organization as the Italian policy
required, substituting, for instance, the Gregorian for the
Ambrosian chant, and, wherever his priests resisted, he took
from them by force their antiphonaries. As an example
to insubordinates he, at the request of the pope, burnt
some of the singers along with their books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He declines image-worship,</div>

<p>The rapid growth of the power of Charlemagne, his
overshadowing pre-eminence, and the subordinate position
of the pope, who had really become his Italian lieutenant,
are strikingly manifested by the event of image-worship in
the West. On this, as we shall in another chapter
see, the popes had revolted from their iconoclastic
sovereigns of Constantinople. The second
Council of Nicea had authorized image-worship, but the
good sense of Charlemagne was superior to such idolatry.
He openly expressed his disapproval, and even dictated a
work against it&mdash;the Carolinian books. The pope was
therefore placed in a singular dilemma, for not only had
image-worship been restored at Constantinople, and the
original cause of the dispute removed, but the new protector,
<span class="sidenote">but permits relic-worship.</span>
Charlemagne, had himself embraced iconoclasm.
However, it was not without reason that the
pope at this time avoided the discussion, for a
profitable sale of bones and relics, said to be those of saints
but in reality obtained from the catacombs of Rome, had
arisen. To the barbarian people of the north these gloomy
objects proved more acceptable than images of wood, and
the traffic, though contemptible, was more honourable than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the slave-trade in vassals and peasant children which had
been carried on with Jews and Mohammedans. Like all
the great statesmen of antiquity, who were unable to
comprehend the possibility of a highly civilized society
<span class="sidenote">His policy as respects slavery.</span>
without the existence of slavery, Charlemagne accepted
that unfortunate condition as a political necessity,
and attempted to draw from it as much benefit
as it was capable of yielding to the state. From
certain classes of slaves he appointed, by a system of
apprenticeship, those who should be devoted to the
mechanical arts and to trade. It was, however, slavery
and warfare which, during his own life, by making the
possession of property among small proprietors an absolute
disadvantage, prepared the way for that rapid dissolution
of his empire so quickly occurring after his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The European slave-trade.</div>

<p>Yet, though Charlemagne thus accepted the existence of
slavery as a necessary political evil, the evidences are not
wanting that he was desirous to check its abuses wherever
he could. When the Italian dukes accused Pope
Adrian of selling his vassals as slaves to the Saracens,
Charlemagne made inquiry into the matter,
and, finding that transactions of the kind had occurred in
the port of Civita Vecchia, though he did not choose to
have so infamous a scandal made public, he ever afterwards
withdrew his countenance from that pope. At that time a
very extensive child slave-trade was carried on with the
Saracens through the medium of the Jews, ecclesiastics as
well as barons selling the children of their serfs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvements of the physical state
of the people.<br /><br />
State of the clergy.</div>

<p>Though he never succeeded in learning how to write,
no one appreciated better than Charlemagne the value of
knowledge. He laboured assiduously for the elevation
and enlightenment of his people. He collected
together learned men; ordered his clergy to turn
their attention to letters; established schools
of religious music; built noble palaces, churches,
bridges; transferred, for the adornment of his capital,
Aix-la-Chapelle, statues from Italy; organized the professions
and trades of his cities, and gave to his towns a
police. Well might he be solicitous that his
clergy should not only become more devout, but
more learned. Very few of them knew how to read,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
scarcely any to write. Of the first half of the eighth century,
a period of great interest, since it includes the
invasion of France by the Saracens, and their expulsion,
there is nothing more than the most meagre annals; the
clergy understood much better the use of the sword than
that of the pen. The schools of Charlemagne proved a
failure, not through any fault of his, but because the age
had no demand for learning, and the Roman pontiffs and
their clergy, as far as they troubled themselves with any
opinion about the matter, thought that knowledge was of
more harm than good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Private life of Charlemagne.</div>

<p>The private life of Charlemagne was stained with great
immoralities and crimes. He indulged in a
polygamy scarcely inferior to that of the khalifs,
solacing himself with not less than nine wives and many
concubines. He sought to increase the circle of the former,
or perhaps it should be said, considering the greatness of
his statesmanship, to unite the Eastern and Western
empires together by a marriage with the Empress Irene.
This was that Irene who put out the eyes of her own son in
the porphyry chamber at Constantinople. His fame
extended into Asia. The Khalif Haroun al Raschid, <small>A.D.</small>
<span class="sidenote">His relations with the Saracens.</span>
801, sent him from Bagdad the keys of our Saviour's
sepulchre as a mark of esteem from the Commander of the
Faithful to the greatest of Christian kings.
However, there was doubtless as much policy as
esteem in this, for the Asiatic khalifs perceived the
advantage of a good understanding with the power that
could control the emirs of Spain. Always bearing in mind
his engagement with the papacy, that Roman Christianity
should be enforced upon Europe wherever his influence
could reach, he remorselessly carried into execution the
penalty of death that he had awarded to the crimes of, 1, refusing
baptism; 2, false pretence of baptism; 3, relapse to
idolatry; 4, the murder of a priest or bishop; 5, human
sacrifice; 6, eating meat in Lent. To the pagan German
his sword was a grim, but a convincing missionary. To
the last he observed a savage fidelity to his bond. He
died <small>A.D.</small> 814.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Course of events after the death of Charlemagne.</div>

<p>Such was the compact that had been established between
the Church and the State. As might be expected, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
succeeding transactions exhibit an alternate preponderance
of one and of the other, and the degradation of both in
the end. Scarcely was Charlemagne dead ere
the imbecile character of his son and successor,
Louis the Pious, gave the Church her opportunity.
By the expulsion of his father's numerous
concubines and mistresses, the scandals of the palace were
revealed. I have not the opportunity to relate in detail
how this monarch disgracefully humiliated himself before
the Church; how, under his weak government, the slave-trade
greatly increased; how every shore, and, indeed,
every country that could be reached through a navigable
river, was open to the ravages of pirates, the Northmen
extending their maraudings even to the capture of great
cities; how, in strong contrast with the social decomposition
into which Europe was falling, Spain, under her Mohammedan
rulers, was becoming rich, populous, and great;
how, on the east, the Huns and Avars, ceasing their ravages,
accepted Christianity, and, under their diversity of interests
the nations that had been bound together by Charlemagne
separated into two divisions&mdash;French and German&mdash;and
civil wars between them ensued; how, through the folly
of the clergy, who vainly looked for protection from relics
instead of the sword, the Saracens ranged uncontrolled all
over the south, and came within an hair's-breadth of capturing
Rome itself; how France, at this time, had literally
become a theocracy, the clergy absorbing everything that
was worth having; how the pope, trembling at home,
nevertheless maintained an external power by interfering
with domestic life, as in the quarrel with King Lothaire
II. and his wife; how Italy, France, and Germany became,
as Africa and Syria had once been, full of miracles; how,
through these means the Church getting the advantage,
John VIII. thought it expedient to assert his right of disposing
of the imperial crown in the case of Charles the Bald
(the imperial supremacy that Charlemagne had obtained
in reality implied the eventual supremacy of the pope);
how an opportunity which occurred for reconstructing the
empire of the West under Charles the Fat was thwarted
by the imbecility of that sovereign, an imbecility so great
that his nobles were obliged to depose him; how, thereupon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
a number of new kingdoms arose, and Europe fell, by an
inevitable necessity, into a political chaos; how, since
there was thus no protecting government, each great
landowner had to protect himself, and the rightfulness
of private war became recognised; how, through this evil
state, the strange consequence ensued of a great increase
in the population, it becoming the interest of every lord to
raise as many peasants as he could, offering his lands on
personal service, the value of an estate being determined
by the number of retainers it could furnish, and hence
arose the feudal system; how the monarchical principle,
once again getting the superiority, asserted its power
in Germany in Henry the Fowler and his descendants, the
three Othos; how, by these great monarchs, the subjection
of Italy was accomplished, and the morality of the German
clergy vindicated by their attempts at the reformation of
the papacy, which fell to the last degree of degradation,
becoming, in the end, an appanage of the Counts of Tusculum,
and, shameful to be said, in some instances given by
prostitutes to their paramours or illegitimates, in some, to
mere boys of precociously dissolute life; before long, <small>A.D.</small>
1045, it was actually to be sold for money. We have now
approached the close of a thousand years from the birth
of Christ; the evil union of the Church and State, their
rivalries, their intrigues, their quarrels, had produced an
inevitable result, doing the same in the West that they
had done in the East; disorganizing the political system,
<span class="sidenote">Social condition of Europe.</span>
and ending in a universal social demoralization. The
absorption of small properties into large estates steadily
increased the number of slaves; where there had once been
many free families, there was now found only a
rich man. Even of this class the number diminished
by the same process of absorption, until there were
sparsely scattered here and there abbots and counts with
enormous estates worked by herds of slaves, whose numbers,
since sometimes one man possessed more than 20,000 of
them, might deceive us, if we did not consider the vast
surface over which they were spread. Examined in that
way, the West of Europe proves to have been covered with
forests, here and there dotted with a convent or a town.
From those countries, once full of the splendid evidences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of Roman civilization, mankind was fast disappearing.
There was no political cause, until at a later time, when
the feudal system was developed, for calling men into
existence. Whenever there was a partial peace, there was
no occasion for the multiplication of men beyond the intention
of extracting from them the largest possible revenue,
a condition implying their destruction. Soon even the
necessity for legislation ceased; events were left to take
their own course. Through the influence of the monks the
military spirit declined; a vile fetichism of factitious relics,
which were working miracles in all directions, constituted
the individual piety. Whoever died without bequeathing
a part of his property to the Church, died without confession
and the sacraments, and forfeited Christian burial.
Trial by battle, and the ordeals of fire and boiling water,
determined innocence or guilt in those accused of crimes.
Between places at no great distance apart intercommunication
ceased, or, at most, was carried on as in the times of
the Trojan War, by the pedlar travelling with his packs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expected end of the world, <small>A.D.</small> 1000.<br /><br />
Effects of the union of Church and state.</div>

<p>In these deplorable days there was abundant reason to
adopt the popular expectation that the end of
all things was at hand, and that the year 1000
would witness the destruction of the world.
Society was dissolving, the human race was disappearing,
and with difficulty the melancholy ruins of ancient civilization
could be traced. Such was the issue of the second
attempt at the union of political and ecclesiastical
power. In a former chapter we saw what it had
been in the East, now we have found what it
was in the West. Inaugurated in selfishness,
it strengthens itself by violence, is perpetuated by
ignorance, and yields as its inevitable result, social ruin.</p>

<p>And while things were thus going to wreck in the state,
it was no better in the Church. The ill-omened union
between them was bearing its only possible fruit, disgrace
to both&mdash;a solemn warning to all future ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of the new system estimated from the lives
of the popes.</div>

<p>3d. This brings me to the third and remaining topic I
proposed to consider in this chapter, to determine
the actual religious value of the system in process
of being forced upon Europe, using, for
the purpose, that which must be admitted as the
best test&mdash;the private lives of the popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><br />Apology for referring to the biography of the popes.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
To some it might seem, considering the interests of
religion alone, desirable to omit all biographical reference
to the popes; but this cannot be done with
justice to the subject. The essential principle
of the papacy, that the Roman pontiff is the
vicar of Christ upon earth, necessarily obtrudes
his personal relations upon us. How shall we understand
his faith unless we see it illustrated in his life? Indeed,
the unhappy character of those relations was the inciting
cause of the movements in Germany, France, and England,
ending in the extinction of the papacy as an actual political
power, movements to be understood only through a sufficient
knowledge of the private lives and opinions of the
popes. It is well, as far as possible, to abstain from
burdening systems with the imperfections of individuals.
In this case they are inseparably interwoven. The signal
peculiarity of the papacy is that, though its history may
be imposing, its biography is infamous. I shall, however,
forbear to speak of it in this latter respect more than the
occasion seems necessarily to require; shall pass in silence
some of those cases which would profoundly shock my
religious reader, and therefore restrict myself to the ages
between the middle of the eighth and the middle of the
eleventh centuries, excusing myself to the impartial critic
by the apology that these were the ages with which I have
been chiefly concerned in this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The popes from <small>A.D.</small> 757.</div>

<p>On the death of Pope Paul I., who had attained the
pontificate <small>A.D.</small> 757, the Duke of Nepi compelled some
bishops to consecrate Constantine, one of his
brothers, as pope; but more legitimate electors
subsequently, <small>A.D.</small> 768, choosing Stephen IV., the usurper
and his adherents were severely punished; the eyes of Constantine
were put out; the tongue of the Bishop Theodorus
was amputated, and he was left in a dungeon to expire in
the agonies of thirst. The nephews of Pope Adrian seized
his successor, Pope Leo III., <small>A.D.</small> 795, in the street, and,
forcing him into a neighbouring church, attempted to put
out his eyes and cut out his tongue; at a later period, this
pontiff trying to suppress a conspiracy to depose him,
Rome became the scene of rebellion, murder, and conflagration.
His successor, Stephen V., <small>A.D.</small> 816, was
ignominiously driven from the city; his successor, Paschal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
I., was accused of blinding and murdering two ecclesiastics
in the Lateran Palace; it was necessary that imperial
commissioners should investigate the matter, but the pope
died, after having exculpated himself by oath before thirty
bishops. John VIII., <small>A.D.</small> 872, unable to resist the
Mohammedans, was compelled to pay them tribute; the
Bishop of Naples, maintaining a secret alliance with them,
received his share of the plunder they collected. Him
John excommunicated, nor would he give him absolution
unless he would betray the chief Mohammedans and
assassinate others himself. There was an ecclesiastical
conspiracy to murder the pope; some of the treasures of
the Church were seized; and the gate of St. Pancrazia was
opened with false keys, to admit the Saracens into the city.
Formosus, who had been engaged in these transactions,
and excommunicated as a conspirator for the murder of
John, was subsequently elected pope, <small>A.D.</small> 891; he was
succeeded by Boniface VI., <small>A.D.</small> 896, who had been deposed
from the diaconate, and again from the priesthood, for his
immoral and lewd life. By Stephen VII., who followed,
the dead body of Formosus was taken from the grave,
clothed in the papal habiliments, propped up in a chair,
tried before a council, and the preposterous and indecent
scene completed by cutting off three of the fingers
of the corpse and casting it into the Tiber; but Stephen
himself was destined to exemplify how low the papacy had
fallen: he was thrown into prison and strangled. In
the course of five years, from <small>A.D.</small> 896 to <small>A.D.</small> 900, five
popes were consecrated. Leo V., who succeeded in <small>A.D.</small> 904,
was in less than two months thrown into prison by
Christopher, one of his chaplains, who usurped his place,
and who, in his turn, was shortly expelled from Rome by
Sergius III., who, by the aid of a military force, seized the
pontificate, <small>A.D.</small> 905. This man, according to the testimony
of the times, lived in criminal intercourse with the celebrated
prostitute Theodora, who, with her daughters
Marozia and Theodora, also prostitutes, exercised an extraordinary
control over him. The love of Theodora was
also shared by John X.: she gave him first the archbishopric
of Ravenna, and then translated him to Rome,
<small>A.D.</small> 915, as pope. John was not unsuited to the times; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
organized a confederacy which perhaps prevented Rome
from being captured by the Saracens, and the world was
astonished and edified by the appearance of this warlike
pontiff at the head of his troops. By the love of Theodora,
as was said, he had maintained himself in the papacy for
fourteen years; by the intrigues and hatred of her daughter
Marozia he was overthrown. She surprised him in the
Lateran Palace; killed his brother Peter before his face;
threw him into prison, where he soon died, smothered, as
was asserted, with a pillow. After a short interval
Marozia made her own son pope as John XI., <small>A.D.</small> 931.
Many affirmed that Pope Sergius was his father, but she
herself inclined to attribute him to her husband Alberic,
whose brother Guido she subsequently married. Another
of her sons, Alberic, so called from his supposed father,
jealous of his brother John, cast him and their mother
Marozia into prison. After a time Alberic's son was elected
pope, <small>A.D.</small> 956; he assumed the title of John XII., the
amorous Marozia thus having given a son and a grandson
to the papacy. John was only nineteen years old when he
thus became the head of Christendom. His reign was
characterized by the most shocking immoralities, so that
the Emperor Otho I. was compelled by the German clergy
to interfere. A synod was summoned for his trial in the
Church of St. Peter, before which it appeared that John
had received bribes for the consecration of bishops, that he
had ordained one who was but ten years old, and had
performed that ceremony over another in a stable; he was
charged with incest with one of his father's concubines,
and with so many adulteries that the Lateran Palace had
become a brothel; he put out the eyes of one ecclesiastic
and castrated another, both dying in consequence of their
injuries; he was given to drunkenness, gambling, and the
invocation of Jupiter and Venus. When cited to appear
before the council, he sent word that "he had gone out
hunting;" and to the fathers who remonstrated with him, he
threateningly remarked "that Judas, as well as the other
disciples, received from his master the power of binding
and loosing, but that as soon as he proved a traitor to the
common cause, the only power he retained was that of
binding his own neck." Hereupon he was deposed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Leo VIII. elected in his stead, <small>A.D.</small> 963; but subsequently
getting the upper hand, he seized his antagonists, cut off
the hand of one, the nose, finger, tongue of others. His life
was eventually brought to an end by the vengeance of a
man whose wife he had seduced.</p>

<p>After such details it is almost needless to allude to the
annals of succeeding popes: to relate that John XIII.
was strangled in prison; that Boniface VII. imprisoned
Benedict VII., and killed him by starvation; that John
XIV. was secretly put to death in the dungeons of the
Castle of St. Angelo; that the corpse of Boniface was
dragged by the populace through the streets. The
sentiment of reverence for the sovereign pontiff, nay,
even of respect, had become extinct in Rome; throughout
Europe the clergy were so shocked at the state of things,
that, in their indignation, they began to look with approbation
on the intention of the Emperor Otho to take from
the Italians their privilege of appointing the successor of
St. Peter, and confine it to his own family. But his
kinsman, Gregory V., whom he placed on the pontifical
throne, was very soon compelled by the Romans to fly;
his excommunications and religious thunders were turned
into derision by them; they were too well acquainted
with the true nature of those terrors; they were living
behind the scenes. A terrible punishment awaited the
Anti-pope John XVI. Otho returned into Italy, seized
him, put out his eyes, cut off his nose and tongue, and
sent him through the streets mounted on an ass, with his
face to the tail, and a wine-bladder on his head. It
seemed impossible that things could become worse; yet
Rome had still to see Benedict IX., <small>A.D.</small> 1033, a boy of
less than twelve years, raised to the apostolic throne. Of
this pontiff, one of his successors, Victor III., declared
that his life was so shameful, so foul, so execrable, that he
<span class="sidenote">The papacy bought at auction <small>A.D.</small>
1045, by Gregory VI.</span>
shuddered to describe it. He ruled like a captain of
banditti rather than a prelate. The people at
last, unable to bear his adulteries, homicides,
and abominations any longer, rose against him.
In despair of maintaining his position, he put
up the papacy to auction. It was bought by a presbyter
named John, who became Gregory VI., <small>A.D.</small> 1045.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion respecting this biography.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
More than a thousand years had elapsed since the birth of
our Saviour, and such was the condition of Rome. Well may
the historian shut the annals of those times in
disgust; well may the heart of the Christian
sink within him at such a catalogue of hideous
crimes. Well may he ask, Were these the vicegerents of God
upon earth&mdash;these, who had truly reached that goal beyond
which the last effort of human wickedness cannot pass?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The philosophical conclusion at last attained.<br /><br />
The evils imputed to the nature of papal election.</div>

<p>Not until several centuries after these events did public
opinion come to the true and philosophical conclusion&mdash;the
total rejection of the divine claims
of the papacy. For a time the evils were attributed
to the manner of the pontifical election,
as if that could by any possibility influence the descent
of a power which claimed to be supernatural and under
the immediate care of God. The manner of election was
this. The Roman ecclesiastics recommended a candidate
to the College of Cardinals; their choice had to
be ratified by the populace of Rome, and, after
that, the emperor must give his approval. There
were thus to be brought into agreement the
machinations of the lower ecclesiastics, the intrigues of
the cardinals, the clamours of the rabble of Rome, and the
policy of the emperor. Such a system must inevitably
break to pieces with its own incongruities. Though we
may wonder that men failed to see that it was merely a
human device, we cannot wonder that the emperors
perceived the necessity of taking the appointments into
their own hands, and that Gregory VII. was resolved to
confine it to the College of Cardinals, to the exclusion of
the emperor, the Roman people, and even of the rest of
Christendom&mdash;an attempt in which he succeeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human origin of the papacy.</div>

<p>No one can study the development of the Italian ecclesiastical
power without discovering how completely it
depended on human agency, too often on human
passion and intrigues; how completely wanting
it was of any mark of the Divine construction and care&mdash;the
offspring of man, not of God, and therefore bearing
upon it the lineaments of human passions, human virtues,
and human sins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of the influence of the Arabians.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> military operations of the Arabians, described in
Chapter XI., overthrew the Byzantine political
system, prematurely closing the Age of Faith
in the East; their intellectual procedure gave
rise to an equally important result, being destined,
in the end, to close the Age of Faith in the West.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
The Saracens not only destroyed the Italian offshoot, they
also impressed characteristic lineaments on the Age of
Reason in Europe.</p>

<p>Events so important make it necessary for me to turn
aside from the special description of European intellectual
advancement, and offer a digression on the passage of the
Arabians to their Age of Reason. It is impossible for us
to understand their action in the great drama about to be
performed unless we understand the character they had
assumed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their intellectual progress.</div>

<p>In a few centuries the fanatics of Mohammed had
altogether changed their appearance. Great
philosophers, physicians, mathematicians, astronomers,
alchemists, grammarians, had arisen among them.
Letters and science, in all their various departments, were
cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their teachers were the Nestorians and Jews.</div>

<p>A nation stirred to its profoundest depths by warlike
emigration, and therefore ready to make, as soon as it
reaches a period of repose, a rapid intellectual
advance, may owe the path in which it is about
to pass to those who are in the position of
pointing it out, or of officiating as teachers.
The teachers of the Saracens were the Nestorians and
the Jews.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their scientific progress was through medicine.</div>

<p>It has been remarked that Arabian science emerged out
of medicine, and that in its cultivation physicians took
the lead, its beginnings being in the pursuit of alchemy.
In this chapter I have to describe the origin of
these facts, and therefore must consider the
state of Greek and Egyptian medicine, and
relate how, wherever the Byzantine system could
reach, true medical philosophy was displaced by relic
and shrine-curing; and how it was, that while European
ideas were in all directions reposing on the unsubstantial
basis of the supernatural, those of the Saracens were
resting on the solid foundation of a material support.</p>

<p>When the Arabs conquered Egypt, their conduct was
that of bigoted fanatics; it justified the accusation made
by some against them, that they burned the Alexandrian
library for the purpose of heating the baths. But scarcely
were they settled in their new dominion when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
exhibited an extraordinary change. At once they became
lovers and zealous cultivators of learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of their union with Nestorians and Jews.</div>

<p>The Arab power had extended in two directions, and
had been submitted to two influences. In Asia it had
been exposed to the Nestorians, in Africa to the Jews,
both of whom had suffered persecution at the
hands of the Byzantine government, apparently
for the same opinion as that which had now
established itself by the sword of Mohammed.
The doctrine of the unity of God was their common point
of contact. On this they could readily affiliate, and hold
in common detestation the trinitarian power at Constantinople.
He who is suffering the penalties of the law as a
heretic, or who is pursued by judicial persecution as
a misbeliever, will readily consort with others reputed to
cherish similar infidelities. Brought into unison in Asia
with the Nestorians, and in Africa with the Alexandrian
Jews, the Arabians became enthusiastic admirers of
learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medicine becomes their neutral ground.</div>

<p>Not that there was between the three parties thus
coalescing a complete harmony of sentiment in the theological
direction; for, though the Nestorians and the Jews
were willing to accept one-half of the Arabian
dogma, that there is but one God, they could
not altogether commit themselves to the other,
that Mohammed is his Prophet. Perhaps
estrangement on this point might have arisen, but
fortunately a remarkable circumstance opened the way for
a complete understanding between them. Almost from
the beginning the Nestorians had devoted themselves to
the study of medicine, and had paid much attention to the
structure and diseases of the body of man; the Jews had
long produced distinguished physicians. These medical
studies presented, therefore, a neutral ground on which
the three parties could intellectually unite in harmony;
and so thoroughly did the Arabians affiliate with these
their teachers, that they acquired from them a characteristic
mental physiognomy. Their physicians were their
great philosophers; their medical colleges were their foci
of learning. While the Byzantines obliterated science in
theology, the Saracens illuminated it by medicine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Byzantine suppression of medicine.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
When Constantine the Great and his successors, under
ecclesiastical influence, had declared themselves the enemies
of worldly learning, it became necessary for the
clergy to assume the duty of seeing to the
physical as well as the religious condition of
the people. It was unsuited to the state of things that
physicians, whose philosophical tendencies inclined them
to the pagan party, should be any longer endured. Their
education in the Asclepions imparted to them ideas in
opposition to the new policy. An edict of Constantine
suppressed those establishments, ample provision being,
however, made for replacing them by others more agreeable
to the genius of Christianity. Hospitals and
<span class="sidenote">Substitution of public charities.</span>
benevolent organizations were founded in the chief cities,
and richly endowed with money and lands.
In these merciful undertakings the empress-mother,
Helena, was distinguished, her example
being followed by many high-born ladies. The heart of
women, which is naturally open to the desolate and afflicted,
soon gives active expression to its sympathies when it is
sanctified by Christian faith. In this, its legitimate
direction, Christianity could display its matchless benevolence
and charities. Organizations were introduced
upon the most extensive and varied scale; one had charge
of foundlings, another of orphans, another of the poor. We
have already alluded to the parabolani or visitors, and of
the manner in which they were diverted from their
original intent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradual fall into miracle-cure.</div>

<p>But, noble as were these charities, they laboured under
an essential defect in having substituted for educated
physicians well-meaning but unskilful ecclesiastics. The
destruction of the Asclepions was not attended by any
suitably extensive measures for insuring professional education.
The sick who were placed in the benevolent
institutions were, at the best, rather
under the care of kind nurses than under the
advice of physicians; and the consequences are seen in the
gradually increasing credulity and imposture of succeeding
ages, until, at length, there was an almost universal
reliance on miraculous interventions. Fetiches, said to be
the relics of saints, but no better than those of tropical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Africa, were believed to cure every disorder. To the
shrines of saints crowds repaired as they had at one time
to the temples of Æsculapius. The worshippers remained,
though the name of the divinity was changed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closing of the schools of medicine and philosophy.</div>

<p>Scarcely were the Asclepions closed, the schools of
philosophy prohibited, the libraries dispersed
or destroyed, learning branded as magic or
punished as treason, philosophers driven into
exile and as a class exterminated, when it became
apparent that a void had been created which it was incumbent
on the victors to fill. Among the great prelates,
who was there to stand in the place of those men whose
achievements had glorified the human race? Who was to
succeed to Archimedes, Hipparchus, Euclid, Herophilus,
Eratosthenes? who to Plato and Aristotle? The quackeries
of miracle-cure, shrine-cure, relic-cure, were destined to
eclipse the genius of Hippocrates, and nearly two thousand
years to intervene between Archimedes and Newton, nearly
seventeen hundred between Hipparchus and Kepler. A
dismal interval of almost twenty centuries parts Hero,
whose first steam-engine revolved in the Serapion, from
James Watt, who has revolutionized the industry of the
world. What a fearful blank! Yet not a blank, for it
had its products&mdash;hundreds of patristic folios filled with
obsolete speculation, oppressing the shelves of antique
libraries, enveloped in dust, and awaiting the worm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its deplorable results.</div>

<p>Never was a more disastrous policy adopted than the
Byzantine suppression of profane learning. It
is scarcely possible now to realize the mental
degradation produced when that system was at its height.
Many of the noblest philosophical and scientific works of
antiquity disappeared from the language in which they
had been written, and were only recovered, for the use of
later and better ages, from translations which the Saracens
had made into Arabic. The insolent assumption of wisdom
by those who held the sword crushed every intellectual
aspiration. Yet, though triumphant for a time, this policy
necessarily contained the seeds of its own ignominious
destruction. A day must inevitably come when so grievous
a wrong to the human race must be exposed, and execrated,
and punished&mdash;a day in which the poems of Homer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Insecurity of the Byzantine system.</span>
might once more be read, the immortal statues of the Greek
sculptors find worshippers, and the demonstrations
of Euclid a consenting intellect. But that
unfortunate, that audacious policy of usurpation
once entered upon, there was no going back. He who is
infallible must needs be immutable. In its very nature the
action implied compulsion, compulsion implied the possession
of power, and the whole policy insured an explosion
the moment that the means of compression should be weak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bigotry of the first Saracens.</div>

<p>It is said that when the Saracens captured Alexandria,
their victorious general sent to the khalif to know his
pleasure respecting the library. The answer was in the
spirit of the age. "If the books be confirmatory of the
Koran, they are superfluous; if contradictory,
they are pernicious. Let them be burnt." At
this moment, to all human appearance, the Mohammedan
autocrat was on the point of joining in the evil policy of
the Byzantine sovereign. But fortunately it was but the
impulse of a moment, rectified forthwith, and a noble
course of action was soon pursued. The Arab incorporated
<span class="sidenote">The nobler policy soon pursued.</span>
into his literature the wisdom of those he had conquered.
In thus conceding to knowledge a free and unembarrassed
career, and, instead of repressing,
encouraging to the utmost all kinds of learning
did the Koran take any harm? It was a high statesmanship
which, almost from the beginning of the impulse from
Mecca, bound down to a narrow, easily comprehended, and
easily expressed dogma the exacted belief, and in all other
particulars let the human mind go free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true causes of the preceding events.</div>

<p>In the preceding paragraphs I have criticized the course
of events, condemning or applauding the actions and the
actors as circumstances seem to require, herein following
the usual course, which implies that men can control
affairs, and that the agent is to be held responsible for his
deed. We have, however, only to consider the
course of our own lives to be satisfied to how
limited an extent such is the case. We are, as
we often say, the creatures of circumstances. In
that expression there is a higher philosophy than might
at first sight appear. Our actions are not the pure and
unmingled results of our desires; they are the offspring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
many various and mixed conditions. In that which seems
to be the most voluntary decision there enters much
that is altogether involuntary&mdash;more, perhaps, than we
generally suppose. And, in like manner, those who
are imagined to have exercised an irresponsible and
spontaneous influence in determining public policy, and
thereby fixing the fate of nations, will be found, when we
understand their position more correctly, to have been the
creatures of circumstances altogether independent and
irrespective of them&mdash;circumstances which they never
created, of whose influence they only availed themselves.
They were placed in a current which drifted them
irresistibly along.</p>

<p>From this more accurate point of view we should therefore
consider the course of these events, recognizing the
principle that the affairs of men pass forward in a
determinate way, expanding and unfolding themselves.
And hence we see that the things of which we have spoken
as though they were matters of choice were, in reality,
forced upon their apparent authors by the necessity of the
times. But, in truth, they should be considered as the
presentations of a certain phase of life which nations in
their onward course sooner or later assume. In the individual,
how well we know that a sober moderation of
action, an appropriate gravity of demeanour, belong to the
mature period of life; a change from the wanton wilfulness
of youth, which may be ushered in, or its beginning
marked, by many accidental incidents: in one perhaps by
domestic bereavements, in another by the loss of fortune,
in a third by ill health. We are correct enough in
imputing to such trials the change of character, but we
never deceive ourselves by supposing that it would have
failed to take place had those incidents not occurred.
There runs an irresistible destiny in the midst of all these
vicissitudes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Succession of affairs determined by law.</div>

<p>We may therefore be satisfied that, whatever may have
been the particular form of the events of which
we have had occasion to speak, their order of
succession was a matter of destiny, and altogether
beyond the reach of any individual. We may condemn
the Byzantine monarchs, or applaud the Arabian khalifs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>&mdash;our
blame and our praise must be set at their proper value.
Europe was passing from its Age of Inquiry to its Age of
Faith. In such a transition the predestined underlies the
voluntary. There are analogies between the life of a
nation and that of an individual, who, though he may be
in one respect the maker of his own fortunes for happiness or
for misery, for good or for evil, though he remains here or
goes there, as his inclinations prompt, though he does this
or abstains from that as he chooses, is nevertheless held
fast by an inexorable fate&mdash;a fate which brought him into
the world involuntarily so far as he was concerned, which
presses him forward through a definite career, the stages of
which are absolutely invariable&mdash;infancy, childhood, youth,
maturity, old age, with all their characteristic actions and
passions, and which removes him from the scene at the
appointed time, in most cases against his will. So also it
is with nations; the voluntary is only the outward
semblance, covering, but hardly hiding the predetermined.
Over the events of life we may have control, but none
whatever over the law of its progress. There is a
geometry that applies to nations, an equation of their
curve of advance. That no mortal man can touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabian science in its stage of sorcery.</div>

<p>We have now to examine in what manner the glimmering
lamp of knowledge was sustained when it was all but
ready to die out. By the Arabians it was
handed down to us. The grotesque forms of
some of those who took charge of it are not
without interest. They exhibit a strange
mixture of the Neo-platonist, the Pantheist, the Mohammedan,
the Christian. In such untoward times, it was
perhaps needful that the strongest passions of men
should be excited and science stimulated by inquiries for
methods of turning lead into gold, or of prolonging life
indefinitely. We have now to deal with the philosopher's
stone, the elixir vitæ, the powder of projection, magical
mirrors, perpetual lamps, the transmutation of metals. In
smoky caverns under ground, where the great work is
stealthily carried on, the alchemist and his familiar are
busy with their alembics, cucurbites, and pelicans, maintaining
their fires for so many years that salamanders are
asserted to be born in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Experimental science was thus restored, though under a
very strange aspect, by the Arabians. Already it displayed
its connexion with medicine&mdash;a connexion derived
from the influence of the Nestorians and the Jews. It is
necessary for us to consider briefly the relations of each,
and of the Nestorians first.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">The Nestorians.</div>

<p>In Chapter IX. we have related the rivalries of Cyril,
the Bishop of Alexandria, and Nestorius, the Bishop of
Constantinople. The theological point of their
quarrel was whether it is right to regard the
Virgin Mary as the mother of God. To an Egyptian still
tainted with ancient superstition, there was nothing
shocking in such a doctrine. His was the country of Isis.
St. Cyril, who is to be looked upon as a mere ecclesiastical
demagogue, found his purposes answered by adopting it
without any scruple. But in Greece there still remained
traces of the old philosophy. A recollection of the ideas
of Plato had not altogether died out. There were some by
whom it was not possible for the Egyptian doctrine to be
received. Such, perhaps, was Nestorius, whose sincerity
was finally approved by an endurance of persecutions, by
his sufferings, and his death. He and his followers,
insisting on the plain inference of the last verse of the first
chapter of St. Matthew, together with the fifty-fifth and
<span class="sidenote">They deny the virginity of the queen of heaven.</span>
fifty-sixth verses of the thirteenth of the same Gospel,
could never be brought to an acknowledgment of the
perpetual virginity of the new queen of heaven.
We have described the issue of the Council of
Ephesus: the Egyptian faction gained the
victory, the aid of court females being called in,
and Nestorius, being deposed from his office, was driven,
with his friends into exile. The philosophical tendency
of the vanquished was soon indicated by their actions.
While their leader was tormented in an African oasis,
many of them emigrated to the Euphrates, and founded the
Chaldæan Church. Under its auspices the college at
Edessa, with several connected schools, arose. In these
were translated into Syriac many Greek and Latin works,
as those of Aristotle and Pliny. It was the Nestorians
who, in connexion with the Jews, founded the medical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">They begin to cultivate medicine.<br /><br />

college of Djondesabour, and first instituted a system of
academical honours which has descended to
our times. It was the Nestorians who were not
only permitted by the khalifs the free exercise of
their religion, but even intrusted with the education of
the children of the great Mohammedan families, a liberality
in striking contrast to the fanaticism of Europe.
The Khalif Alraschid went so far as even to
place all his public schools under the superintendence
of John Masué, one of that sect.
Under the auspices of these learned men the Arabian
academies were furnished with translations of Greek
authors, and vast libraries were collected in Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their great spread in the East,</div>

<p>Through this connexion with the Arabs, Nestorian
missionaries found means to disseminate their
form of Christianity all over Asia, as far as
Malabar and China. The successful intrigues of
the Egyptian politicians at Ephesus had no influence in
those remote countries, the Asiatic churches of the Nestorian
and Jacobite persuasions outnumbering eventually all the
European Christians of the Greek and Roman churches
combined. In later times the papal government has made
great exertions to bring about an understanding with
them, but in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and persecutions in the West.</div>

<p>The expulsion of this party from Constantinople was
accomplished by the same persons and policy concerned in
destroying philosophy in Alexandria. St. Cyril was the
representative of an illiterate and unscrupulous
faction that had come into the possession of
power through intrigues with the females of the
imperial court, and bribery of eunuchs and parasites.
The same spirit that had murdered Hypatia tormented
Nestorius to death. Of the contending parties, one was
respectable and had a tincture of learning, the other
ignorant, and not hesitating at the employment of brute
force, deportation, assassination. Unfortunately for the
world, the unscrupulous party carried the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They inherit the old Greek medicine.</div>

<p>By their descent, the Nestorians had become the
depositaries of the old Greek medical science.
Its great names they revered. They collected,
with the utmost assiduity, whatever works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
remained on medical topics, whether of a Greek or Alexandrian
origin, from the writings of Hippocrates, called,
with affectionate veneration by his successors, "The
Divine Old Man," down to those of the Ptolemaic school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of Greek medicine&mdash;Asclepions.</div>

<p>Greek medicine arose in the temples of Æsculapius,
whither the sick were in the habit of resorting for the
assistance of the god. It does not appear that any fee
was exacted for the celestial advice; but the
gratitude of the patient was frequently displayed
by optional gifts, and votive tablets presented
to the temple, setting forth the circumstances
of the case, were of value to those disposed to enter
on medical studies. The Asclepions thus became both
hospitals and schools. They exercised, from their position,
a tendency to incorporate medical and ecclesiastical
pursuits. At this time it was universally believed that
every sickness was due to the anger of some offended god,
and especially was this supposed to be the case in epidemics
and plagues. Such a paralyzing notion was necessarily
inconsistent with any attempt at the relief of communities
by the exercise of sanitary measures. In our times it is
still difficult to remove from the minds of the illiterate
classes this ancient opinion, or to convince them that
under such visitations we ought to help ourselves, and
not expect relief by penance and supplications, unless we
join therewith rigorous personal, domestic, municipal
<span class="sidenote">Hippocrates destroys the theological theory of disease.</span>
cleanliness, fresh air, and light. The theological
doctrine of the nature of disease indicated its
means of cure. For Hippocrates was reserved
the great glory of destroying them both, replacing
them by more practical and material ideas, and,
from the votive tablets, traditions, and other sources,
together with his own admirable observations, compiling
a body of medicine. The necessary consequence of his
great success was the separation of the pursuits of the
physician from those of the priest. Not that so great a
revolution, implying the diversion of profitable gains
from the ancient channel, could have been accomplished
without a struggle. We should reverence the memory of
Hippocrates for the complete manner in which he effected
that object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Writings of Hippocrates.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Of the works attributed to Hippocrates, many are
doubtless the production of his family, his descendants, or
his pupils. The inducements to literary forgery
in the times of the Ptolemies, who paid very
high prices for books of reputation, have been the cause
of much difficulty among critics in determining such
questions of authorship. The works indisputably written
by Hippocrates display an extent of knowledge answering
to the authority of his name; his vivid descriptions have
never been excelled, if indeed they have ever been equalled.
The Hippocratic face of the dying is still retained in
our medical treatises in the original terms, without any
improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His opinions.</div>

<p>In his medical doctrine, Hippocrates starts with the
postulate that the body is composed of the four
elements. From these are formed the four
cardinal humours. He thinks that the humours are liable
to undergo change; that health consists in their right
constitution and proper adjustment as to quantity; disease,
in their impurities and inequalities; that the disordered
humours undergo spontaneous changes or coction, a process
requiring time, and hence the explanation of critical days
and critical discharges. The primitive disturbance of the
humours he attributed to a great variety of causes, chiefly
to the influence of physical circumstances, such as heat,
cold, air, water. Unlike his contemporaries, he did not
impute all the afflictions of man to the anger of the gods.
Along with those influences of an external kind, he studied
the special peculiarities of the human system, how it is
modified by climate and manner of life, exhibiting different
predispositions at different seasons of the year. He believed
that the innate heat of the body varies with the period of
life, being greatest in infancy and least in old age, and
that hence morbific agents affect us with greater or less
facility at different times. For this reason it is that the
physician should attend very closely to the condition of
those in whom he is interested as respects their diet and
exercise, for thereby he is able not only to regulate their
general susceptibility, but also to exert a control over the
course of their diseases.</p>

<p>Referring diseases in general to the condition or distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of the humours, for he regards inflammation as
the passing of blood into parts not previously containing
it, he considers that so long as those liquids occupy the
system in an unnatural or adulterated state, disease continues;
but as they ferment or undergo coction, various
characteristic symptoms appear, and, when their elaboration
is completed, they are discharged by perspiration or
other secretions, by alvine dejections, etc. But where
such a general relief of the system is not accomplished,
the peccant humours may be localized in some particular
organ or special portion, and erysipelatous inflammation,
mortification, or other such manifestations ensue. It
is in aiding this elimination from the system that the
physician may signally manifest his skill. His power is
displayed much more at this epoch than by the control he
can exert over the process of coction. Now may he invoke
the virtues of the hellebores, the white and the black,
now may he use elaterium. The critical days which
answer to the periods of the process of coction are to be
watched with anxiety, and the correspondence of the state
of the patient with the expected condition which he ought
to show at those epochs ascertained. Hence the physician
may be able to predict the probable course of the disease
during the remainder of its career, and gather true notions
as to the practice it would be best for him to pursue to aid
Nature in her operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The character of his practice.</div>

<p>It thus appears that the practice of medicine in the
hands of Hippocrates had reference rather to the
course or career of disease than to its special
nature. Nothing more than this masterly conception
is wanted to impress us with his surprizing
scientific power. He watches the manner in which the
humours are undergoing their fermenting coction, the
phenomena displayed in the critical days, the aspect and
nature of the critical discharges. He does not attempt
to check the process going on, but simply to assist the
natural operation.</p>

<p>When we consider the period at which Hippocrates
lived, <small>B.C.</small> 400, and the circumstances under which he had
studied medicine, we cannot fail to admire the very great
advance he made. His merit is conspicuous in rejecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the superstitious tendency of his times by teaching his
disciples to impute a proper agency to physical causes.
He altogether discarded the imaginary influences then in
vogue. For the gods he substituted, with singular felicity,
Impersonal Nature. It was the interest of those who were
connected with the temples of Æsculapius to refer all the
diseases of men to supernatural agency; their doctrine
being that every affliction should be attributed to the
anger of some offended god, and restoration to health most
certainly procured by conciliating his power. So far,
then, as such interests were concerned, any contradiction
of those doctrines, any substitution of the material for the
supernatural, must needs have met with reprehension.
Yet such opposition seems in no respect to have weighed
with this great physician, who developed his theory and
pursued his practice without giving himself any concern
in that respect. He bequeathed an example to all who
succeeded him in his noble profession, and taught them
not to hesitate in encountering the prejudices and passions
of the present for the sake of the truth, and to trust for
their reward in the just appreciation of a future age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His doctrine is truly scientific.</div>

<p>With such remarks we may assert that the medical
philosophy of Hippocrates is worthy of our highest
admiration, since it exhibits the scientific conditions
of deduction and induction. The theory
itself is compact and clear; its lineaments are
completely Grecian. It presents, to one who will contemplate
it with due allowance for its times, the characteristic
quick-sightedness, penetration, and power of the Greek
mind, fully vindicating for its author the title which has
been conferred upon him by his European successors&mdash;the
Father of Medicine&mdash;and perhaps inducing us to excuse
the enthusiastic assertion of Galen, that we ought to
reverence the words of Hippocrates as the voice of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The school of Cnidos.</div>

<p>The Hippocratic school of Cos found a rival in the school
of Cnidos, which offered not only a different view of the
nature of disease, but also taught a different
principle for its cure. The Cnidians paid more
particular attention to the special symptoms in individual
cases, and pursued a less active treatment, declining,
whenever they could, a resort to drastic purgatives, venesection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
or other energetic means. As might be expected,
the professional activity of these schools called into existence
many able men, and produced many excellent
works: thus Philiston wrote on the regimen for persons
in health; Diocles on hygiene and gymnastics; Praxagoras
<span class="sidenote">Is destroyed by Constantine.</span>
on the pulse, showing that it is a measure of the force of
disease. The Asclepion of Cnidos continued
until the time of Constantine, when it was
destroyed along with many other pagan establishments.
The union between the priesthood and the
profession was gradually becoming less and less close;
and, as the latter thus separated itself, divisions or departments
arose in it, both as regards subjects, such as pharmacy,
surgery, etc., and also as respects the position of its
cultivators, some pursuing it as a liberal science, and some
as a mere industrial occupation. In those times, as in our
own, many who were not favoured with the gifts of
fortune were constrained to fall into the latter ranks.
<span class="sidenote">Classes of physicians.</span>
Thus Aristotle, than whom few have ever exerted a greater
intellectual influence upon humanity, after spending his
patrimony in liberal pursuits, kept an apothecary's
shop at Athens. Aristotle the druggist,
behind his counter, selling medicines to chance customers,
is Aristotle the great writer, whose dictum was final with
the schoolmen of the Middle Ages. As a general thing,
however, the medical professors were drawn from the
philosophical class. Outside of these divisions, and though
in all ages continually repudiated by the profession, yet
continually hovering round it, was a host of impostors
and quacks, as there will always be so long as there are
weak-minded and shallow men to be deluded, and vain
and silly women to believe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian medicine. The Museum.</div>

<p>When the Alexandrian Museum was originated by
Ptolemy Philadelphus, its studies were arranged in four
faculties&mdash;literature, mathematics, astronomy,
medicine. These divisions are, however, to be
understood comprehensively: thus, under the
faculty of medicine were included such subjects as natural
history. The physicians who received the first appointments
were Cleombrotus, Herophilus, and Erasistratus;
among the subordinate professors was Philo-Stephanus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
who had charge of natural history, and was directed to
write a book on Fishes. The elevated ideas of the founder
<span class="sidenote">Philadelphus founds medicine on anatomy.<br /><br />
He authorizes dissection and human vivisection.<br /><br /><br />
Physicians of the Alexandrian school.</span>
cannot be better illustrated than by the manner in which
he organized his medical school. It was upon the sure
basis of anatomy. Herophilus and his colleagues were
authorized to resort to the dissection of the dead, and to
ascertain, by that only trustworthy method, the
true structure of the human body. The strong
hand of Ptolemy resolutely carried out his design,
though in a country where popular sentiment
was strongly opposed to such practices. To touch a corpse
in Egypt was an abomination. Nor was it only this great
man's intention to ascertain the human structure; he also
took measures to discover the mode in which its
functions are carried forward, the manner in
which it works. To this end he authorized his
anatomists to make vivisections both of animals,
and also of criminals who had been condemned to death,
herein finding for himself that royal road in physiology
which Euclid once told him, at a dinner in the Museum,
did not exist in geometry, and defending the act from
moral criticism by the plea that, as the culprits had already
forfeited their lives to the law, it was no injury to make
them serviceable to the interests of humanity.
Herophilus had been educated at Cos; his
pathological views were those known as humouralism;
his treatment active, after the manner of Hippocrates,
upon whose works he wrote commentaries. His
original investigations were numerous; they were embodied,
with his peculiar views, in treatises on the practice
of medicine; on obstetrics; on the eye; on the pulse,
which he properly referred to contractions of the heart.
He was aware of the existence of the lacteals, and their
anatomical relation to the mesenteric glands. Erasistratus,
his colleague, was a pupil of Theophrastus and Chrysippus:
he, too, cultivated anatomy. He described the structure
of the heart, its connexions with the arteries and veins,
but fell into the mistake that the former vessels were
for the conveyance of air, the latter for that of blood.
He knew that there are two kinds of nerves, those of
motion and those of sensation. He referred all fevers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
inflammatory states, and in his practice differed from the
received methods of Hippocrates by observing a less active
treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvements in surgery and pharmacy.</div>

<p>By these physicians the study of medicine in Alexandria
was laid upon the solid foundation of anatomy.
Besides them there were many other instructors
in specialties; and, indeed, the temple of Serapis
was used for a hospital, the sick being received
into it, and persons studying medicine admitted for the
purpose of familiarizing themselves with the appearance
of disease, precisely as in similar institutions at the
present time. Of course, under such circumstances, the
departments of surgery and pharmacy received many
improvements, and produced many able men. Among
these improvements may be mentioned new operations, for
lithotomy, instruments for crushing calculi, for reducing
dislocations, etc. The active commerce of Egypt afforded
abundant opportunity for extending the materia medica
by the introduction of a great many herbs and drugs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of Alexandrian medicine.</div>

<p>The medical school of Alexandria, which was thus
originally based upon dissection, in the course of time lost
much of its scientific spirit. But the influence
of the first teachers may be traced through
many subsequent ages. Thus Galen divides the
profession in his time into Herophilians and Erasistratians.
Various sects had arisen in the course of events, as the
Dogmatists, who asserted that diseases can only be treated
correctly by the aid of a knowledge of the structure and
functions, the action of drugs, and the changes induced in
the affected parts; they insisted, therefore, upon the
necessity of anatomy, physiology, therapeutics, and pathology.
They claimed a descent from Hippocrates. Their
antagonists, the Empirics, ridiculed such knowledge as
fanciful or unattainable, and relied on experience alone.
These subdivisions were not limited to sects; they may
also be observed under the form of schools. Even Erasistratus
himself, toward the close of his life, through some
dispute or misunderstanding, appears to have left the
Museum and established a school at Smyrna. The study
of the various branches of medicine was also pursued by
others out of the immediate ranks of the profession.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Mithridates, king of Pontus, thus devoted himself to the
examination of poisons and the discovery of antidotes.</p>

<p>What a fall from this scientific medicine to the miracle-cure
which soon displaced it! What a descent from
Hippocrates and the great Alexandrian physicians to the
shrines of saints and the monks!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">The Jewish physicians.</div>

<p>To the foregoing sketch of the state of Greek medicine
in its day of glory, I must add an examination
of the same science among the Jews subsequently
to the second century; it is necessary for the proper
understanding of the origin of Saracen learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their emancipation from the supernatural.</div>

<p>In philosophy the Jews had been gradually emancipating
themselves from the influence of ancient traditions;
their advance in this direction is shown by the active
manner in which they aided in the development of Neo-platonism.
After the destruction of Jerusalem all Syria
and Mesopotamia were full of Jewish schools;
but the great philosophers, as well as the great
merchants of the nation, were residents of
Alexandria. Persecution and dispersion, if they
served no other good purpose, weakened the grasp of the
ecclesiastic. Perhaps, too, repeated disappointments in
an expected coming of a national temporal Messiah had
brought those who were now advanced in intellectual
progress to a just appreciation of ancient traditions. In
this mental emancipation their physicians took the lead.
For long, while their pursuits were yet in infancy, a bitter
animosity had been manifested toward them by the
Levites, whose manner of healing was by prayer, expiatory
sacrifice, and miracle; or, if they descended to less supernatural
means, by an application of such remedies as are
popular with the vulgar everywhere. Thus, to a person
bitten by a mad dog, they would give the diaphragm of a
dog to eat. As examples of a class of men soon to take no
obscure share in directing human progress may be mentioned
Hannina, <small>A.D.</small> 205, often spoken of by his successors
as the earliest of Jewish physicians; Samuel, equally
distinguished as an astronomer, accoucheur, and oculist,
the inventor of a collyrium which bore his name; Rab,
an anatomist, who wrote a treatise on the structure of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
body of man as ascertained by dissections, thereby attaining
such celebrity that the people, after his death, used
the earth of his grave as a medicine; Abba Oumna, whose
study of insanity plainly shows that he gave a material
interpretation to the national doctrine of possession by
devils, and replaced that strange delusion by the scientific
explanation of corporeal derangement. This honourable
physician made it a rule never to take a fee from the poor,
and never to make any difference in his assiduous attention
between them and the rich. These men may be taken
as a type of their successors to the seventh century, when
the Oriental schools were broken up in consequence of the
Arab military movements. In the Talmudic literature
there are all the indications of a transitional state, so far
as medicine is concerned; the supernatural seems to be
passing into the physical, the ecclesiastical is mixed up
with the exact: thus a rabbi may cure disease by the
ecclesiastical operation of laying on of hands; but of
febrile disturbances, an exact, though erroneous explanation
is given, and paralysis of the hind legs of an animal is
correctly referred to the pressure of a tumour on the spinal
cord. Some of its aphorisms are not devoid of amusing
significance: "Any disease, provided the bowels remain
open; any kind of pain, provided the heart remain unaffected;
any kind of uneasiness, provided the head be not
attacked; all manner of evils, except it be a bad woman."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabs affiliate with them.<br /><br />
Rise of Jewish physicians to influence.</div>

<p>At first, after the fall of the Alexandrian school, it was
all that the Jewish physicians could do to preserve the
learning that had descended to them. But when the
tumult of Arabic conquest was over, we find
them becoming the advisers of crowned heads,
and exerting, by reason of their advantageous
position, their liberal education, their enlarged views, a
most important influence on the intellectual progress of
humanity. Maser Djaivah, physician to the Khalif Moawiyah,
was distinguished at once as a poet, a
critic, a philosopher; Haroun, a physician of
Alexandria, whose Pandects, a treatise unfortunately
now lost, are said to have contained the first
elaborate description of the small-pox and method of its
treatment. Isaac Ben Emran wrote an original treatise on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
poisons and their symptoms, and others followed his example.
The Khalif Al Raschid, who maintained political
relations with Charlemagne by means of Jewish envoys,
<span class="sidenote">They found medical colleges,</span>
set that monarch an example by which indeed he was not
slow to profit, in actively patronising the medical
college at Djondesabour, and founding a university
at Bagdad. He prohibited any person from
practising medicine until after a satisfactory examination
before one of those faculties. In the East the theological
theory of disease and of its cure was fast passing away.
Of the school at Bagdad, Joshua ben Nun is said to have
been the most celebrated professor, the school itself actively
promoting the translation of Greek works into Arabic&mdash;not
<span class="sidenote">and promote science and literature.</span>
alone works of a professional, but also those of a general
kind. In this manner the writings of Plato and Aristotle
were secured; indeed, it is said that almost every
day camels laden with volumes were entering
the gates of Bagdad. To add to the supply, the
Emperor Michael III. was compelled by treaty to furnish
Greek books. The result of this intellectual movement
could be no other than a diffusion of light. Schools arose
in Bassora, Ispahan, Samarcand, Fez, Morocco, Sicily,
Cordova, Seville, Granada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intermingling of magic and sorcery.</div>

<p>Through the Nestorians and the Jews the Arabs thus
became acquainted with the medical science of Greece and
Alexandria; but to this was added other knowledge of a
more sinister kind, derived from Persia, or
perhaps remotely from Chaldee sources, the
Nestorians having important Church establishments
in Mesopotamia, and the Jews having been long
familiar with that country; indeed, from thence their
ancestors originally came. More than once its ideas had
modified their national religion. This extraneous knowledge
was of an astrological or magical nature, carried
into practice by incantations, amulets, charms, and talismans.
<span class="sidenote">Dedication of portions of matter and time to the
supernatural.</span>
Its fundamental principle was that the
planetary bodies exercise an influence over
terrestrial things. As seven planets and seven
metals were at that time known&mdash;the sun, the
moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, being the
planets of astrology&mdash;a due allotment was made. Gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
was held sacred to the sun, silver to the moon, iron to
Mars, etc. Even the portions of time were in like manner
dedicated; the seven days of the week were respectively
given to the seven planets of astrology. The names
imposed on those days, and the order in which they occur,
are obviously connected with the Ptolemaic hypothesis
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the week.</span>
of astronomy, each of the planets having an hour assigned
to it in its order of occurrence, and the planet
ruling first the hour of each day giving its
name to that day. Thus arranged, the week
is a remarkable instance of the longevity of an institution
adapted to the wants of man. It has survived through
many changes of empire, has forced itself on the ecclesiastical
system of Europe, which, unable to change its
idolatrous aspect, has encouraged the vulgar error that it
owes its authenticity to the Holy Scriptures, an error too
plainly betrayed by the pagan names that the days bear,
and also by their order of occurrence.</p>

<p>These notions of dedicating portions of matter or of time
to the supernatural were derived from the doctrine of a
universal spirit or soul of the world, extensively believed
in throughout the East. It underlies, as we have seen in
Chapter III., all Oriental theology, and is at once a very
antique and not unphilosophical conception. Of this soul
the spirit of man was by many supposed to be a particle
like a spark given off from a flame. All other things,
animate or inanimate, brutes, plants, stones, nay, even
natural forms, rivers, mountains, cascades, grottoes, have
each an indwelling and animating spirit.</p>

<p>Amulets and charms, therefore, did not derive their
powers from the material substance of which they consisted,
but from this indwelling spirit. In the case of man, his
immaterial principle was believed to correspond to his
personal bodily form. Of the two great sects into which
the Jewish nation had been divided, the Pharisees accepted
the Assyrian doctrine; but the Sadducees, who denied the
existence of any such spirit, boasted that theirs was the old
Mosaic faith, and denounced their antagonists as having
been contaminated at the time of the Babylonian captivity,
before which catastrophe, according to them, these doctrines
were unheard of in Jerusalem. In Alexandria, among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Alexandrian necromancy.</span>
leading men there were many adherents to these opinions.
Thus Plotinus wrote a book on the association
of dæmons with men, and his disciple Porphyry
proved practically the possibility of such an alliance;
for, repairing to the temple of Isis along with Plotinus
and a certain Egyptian priest, the latter, to prove
his supernatural power, offered to raise up the spirit of
Plotinus himself in a visible form. A magical circle was
drawn on the ground, surrounded with the customary
astrological signs, the invocation commenced, the spirit
appeared, and Plotinus stood face to face with his own soul.
In this successful experiment it is needless to inquire how
much the necromancer depended upon optical contrivances,
and how much upon an alarmed imagination. But if thus
the spirit of a living man could be called up, how much
more likely the souls of the dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These ideas originate in Pantheism.</div>

<p>In reality, these wild doctrines were connected with
Pantheism, which was secretly believed in everywhere;
for, though, in a coarse mode of expression,
a distinction seemed thus to be made
between matter and spirit, or body and soul, it was held
by the initiated that matter itself is a mere shadow of the
spirit, and the body a delusive semblance of the soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The black art.</div>

<p>In the eighth century, many natural facts of a surprising
and unaccountable description, well calculated to make a
profound impression upon those who witnessed
them, had accumulated. They were such as are
now familiar to chemists. Vessels tightly closed were
burst open when tormented in the fire, apparently by some
invisible agency; intangible vapours condensed into solids;
from colourless liquids gaudy precipitates were suddenly
called into existence; flames were disengaged without any
adequate cause; explosions took place spontaneously. So
much that was unexpected and unaccountable justified
the title of "the occult science," "the black art." From
being isolated marvels unconnected with one another, these
facts had been united. The Chaldee notions of a soul of
the world, and of indwelling spirits, had furnished a thread
on which all these pearls, for such they proved to be, might
be strung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabians fall into these delusions,</div>

<p>With avidity&mdash;for there is ever a charm in the supernatural&mdash;did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the Arabs receive from their Nestorian and
Jewish medical instructors these mystical interpretations
along with true knowledge. And far
from resting satisfied with what their masters
had thus delivered, they proceeded forthwith to improve
and extend it for themselves. They submitted all kinds
of substances to all kinds of operations, greatly improving
the experimental process they had been taught. By
exposing various bodies to the fire, they found it possible
to extract from them more refined portions, which seemed
to concentrate in themselves the qualities pertaining in a
more diffuse way to the substances from which they had
been drawn. These, since they were often invisible at
their first disengagement, yet capable of bursting open the
strongest vessels, and sometimes of disappearing in explosions
and flames, they concluded must be the indwelling
spirit or soul of the body, from which the fire had driven
them forth. It was the Chaldee doctrine realized. Thus
they obtained the spirit of wine, the spirit of salt, the spirit
of nitre. We still retain in commerce these designations,
though their significance is lost. When first introduced
they had a strictly literal meaning. Alchemy, with its
essences, quintessences, and spirits, was Pantheism materialized.
God was seen to be in everything, in the
abstract as well as the concrete, in numbers as well as
realities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and the Christians also.</div>

<p>Anticipating what will have hereafter to be considered
in detail, I may here remark that it was not the Mohammedan
alone who delivered himself up to these mystic
delusions; Christendom was prepared for them
also. In its opinion, the earth, the air, the sea,
were full of invisible forms. With more faith than even
by paganism itself was the supernatural power of the images
of the gods accepted, only it was imputed to the influence of
devils. The lunatic was troubled by a like possession. If
a spring discharged its waters with a periodical gushing
of carbonic acid gas, it was agitated by an angel; if an
unfortunate descended into a pit and was suffocated by the
mephitic air, it was by some dæmon who was secreted; if
the miner's torch produced an explosion, it was owing to
the wrath of some malignant spirit guarding a treasure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
and whose solitude had been disturbed. There was no end
to the stories, duly authenticated by the best human
testimony, of the occasional appearance of such spirits
under visible forms; there was no grotto or cool thicket in
which angels and genii had not been seen, no cavern without
its dæmons. Though the names were not yet given, it was
well understood that the air had its sylphs, the earth its
gnomes, the fire its salamanders, the water its undines; to
the day belonged its apparitions, to the night its fairies.
The foul air of stagnant places assumed the visible form
of dæmons of abominable aspect; the explosive gases of
mines took on the shape of pale-faced, malicious dwarfs,
with leathery ears hanging down to their shoulders, and
garments of grey cloth. Philosophical conceptions can
never be disentangled from social ideas; the thoughts of
man will always gather a tincture from the intellectual
medium in which he lives.</p>

<p>In Christendom, however, the chief application of these
doctrines was to the relics of martyrs and saints. As with
the amulets and talismans of Mesopotamia, these were
regarded as possessing supernatural powers. They were a
sure safeguard against evil spirits, and an unfailing relief
in sickness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmutation of metals&mdash;Alchemy.</div>

<p>A singular force was given to these mystic ideas by the
peculiar direction they happened to take. As there are
veins of water in the earth, and apertures through which
the air can gain access, an analogy was inferred between
its structure and that of an animal, leading to an inference
of a similarity of functions. From this came the theory of
the development of metals in its womb under
the influence of the planets, the pregnant earth
spontaneously producing gold and silver from
baser things after a definite number of lunations. Already,
however, in the doctrine of the transmutation of metals, it
was perceived that to Nature the lapse of time is nothing&mdash;to
man it is everything. To Nature, when she is transmuting
a worthless into a better metal, what signify a thousand
years? To man, half a century embraces the period of his
intellectual activity. The aim of the cultivator of the sacred
art should be to shorten the natural term; and, since we
observe the influence of heat in hastening the ripening of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
fruits, may we not reasonably expect that duly regulated
degrees of fire will answer the purpose? by an exposure of
<span class="sidenote">Philosopher's stone.</span>
base material in the furnace for a proper season, may we not
anticipate the wished for event? The Emperor Caligula,
who had formerly tried to make gold from
orpiment by the force of fire, was only one of a
thousand adepts pursuing a similar scheme. Some trusted
to the addition of a material substance in aiding the fire
to purge away the dross of the base body submitted to it.
From this arose the doctrine of the powder of projection
and the philosopher's stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmutation and transubstantiation.</div>

<p>This doctrine of the possibility of transmuting things
into forms essentially different steadily made its way,
leading, in the material direction, to alchemy,
the art of making gold and silver out of baser
metals, and in theology to transubstantiation.
Transmutation and transubstantiation were twin
sisters, destined for a world-wide celebrity; one became
allied to the science of Mecca, the other to the theology of
Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The elixir of life.</div>

<p>While thus the Arabs joined in the pursuit of alchemy,
their medical tendencies led them simultaneously to cultivate
another ancient delusion, the discovery of a
universal panacea or elixir which could cure all
diseases and prolong life for ever. Mystical experimenters
for centuries had been ransacking all nature, from the
yellow flowers which are sacred to the sun, and gold his
emblem and representative on earth, down to the vilest
excrements of the human body. As to gold, there had been
gathered round that metal many fictitious excellences in
addition to its real values; it was believed that in some
<span class="sidenote">Potable gold.</span>
preparation of it would be found the elixir vitæ. This
is the explanation of the unwearied attempts
at making potable gold, for it was universally
thought that if that metal could be obtained in a dissolved
state, it would constitute the long-sought panacea. Nor
did it seem impossible so to increase the power of water, as
to impart to it new virtues, and thereby enable it to accomplish
the desired solution. Were there not natural waters
of very different properties? were there not some that could
fortify the memory, others destroy it; some re-enforce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
spirits, some impart dulness, and some, which were highly
prized, that could secure a return of love? It had been
long known that both natural and artificial waters can
<span class="sidenote">Chemical waters.</span>
permanently affect the health, and that instruments may
be made to ascertain their qualities. Zosimus, the Panopolitan,
had described in former times the operation of
distillation, by which water may be purified; the Arabs
called the apparatus for conducting that experiment
an alembic. His treatise on the virtues
and composition of waters was conveyed under the form of
a dream, in which there flit before us fantastically white-haired
priests sacrificing before the altar; cauldrons of
boiling water, in which there are walking about men a span
long; brazen-clad warriors in silence reading leaden books,
and sphinxes with wings. In such incomprehensible
fictions knowledge was purposely, and ignorance conveniently
concealed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabs originate scientific chemistry.</div>

<p>The practical Arabs had not long been engaged in these
fascinating but wild pursuits, when results of
very great importance began to appear. In a
scientific point of view, the discovery of the strong
acids laid the true foundation of chemistry; in a
political point of view, the invention of gunpowder revolutionized
the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gunpowder and fireworks.</div>

<p>There were several explosive mixtures. Automatic fire
was made from equal parts of sulphur, saltpetre,
and sulphide of antimony, finely pulverized and
mixed into a paste, with equal parts of juice of
the black sycamore and liquid asphaltum, a little quick-lime
being added. It was directed to keep the material
from the rays of the sun, which would set it on fire.</p>

<p>Of liquid or Greek fire we have not a precise description,
since the knowledge of it was kept at Constantinople as a
state secret. There is reason, however, to believe that it contained
sulphur and nitrate of potash mixed with naphtha.
Of gunpowder, Marcus Græcus, whose date is probably
to be referred to the close of the eighth century, gives the
composition explicitly. He directs us to pulverize in a
marble mortar one pound of sulphur, two of charcoal, and
six of saltpetre. If some of this powder be tightly rammed
in a long narrow tube closed at one end, and then set on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
fire, the tube will fly through the air: this is clearly the
rocket. He says that thunder may be imitated by folding
some of the powder in a cover and tying it up tightly:
<span class="sidenote">Incombustible men.</span>
this is the cracker. It thus appears that fireworks preceded
fire-arms. To the same author we are
indebted for prescriptions for making the skin
incombustible, so that we may handle fire without being
burnt. These, doubtless, were received as explanations
of the legends of the times, which related how miracle-workers
had washed their hands in melted copper, and
sat at their ease in flaming straw.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabian chemists.</div>

<p>Among the Saracen names that might be mentioned as
cultivators of alchemy, we may recall El-Rasi,
Ebid Durr, Djafar or Geber, Toghragé, who
wrote an alchemical poem, and Dschildegi, one of whose
works bears the significant title of "The Lantern." The
definition of alchemy by some of these authors is very
striking: the science of the balance, the science of weight,
the science of combustion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Djafar discovers nitric acid and aqua regia,</div>

<p>To one of these chemists, Djafar, our attention may for
a moment be drawn. He lived toward the end
of the eighth century, and is honoured by Rhazes,
Avicenna, and Kalid, the great Arabic physicians,
as their master. His name is memorable
in chemistry, since it marks an epoch in that science of
equal importance to that of Priestley and Lavoisier. He is
the first to describe nitric acid and aqua regia. Before
him no stronger acid was known than concentrated vinegar.
We cannot conceive of chemistry as not possessing acids.
Roger Bacon speaks of him as the magister magistrorum.
He has perfectly just notions of the nature of spirits or
gases, as we call them; thus he says, "O son of the doctrine,
<span class="sidenote">and that oxidation increases weight.</span>
when spirits fix themselves in bodies, they lose
their form; in their nature they are no longer
what they were. When you compel them to
be disengaged again, this is what happens:
either the spirit alone escapes with the air, and the
body remains fixed in the alembic, or the spirit and
body escape together at the same time." His doctrine
respecting the nature of the metals, though erroneous, was
not without a scientific value. A metal he considers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
be a compound of sulphur, mercury, and arsenic, and
hence he infers that transmutation is possible by varying
the proportion of those ingredients. He knows that a
metal, when calcined, increases in weight, a discovery of
the greatest importance, as eventually brought to bear in
the destruction of the doctrine of Phlogiston of Stahl, and
which has been imputed to Europeans of a much later
time. He describes the operations of distillation, sublimation,
filtration, various chemical apparatus, water-baths,
sand-baths, cupels of bone-earth, of the use of which
he gives a singularly clear description. A chemist reads
with interest Djafar's antique method of obtaining nitric
<span class="sidenote">He solves the problem of potable gold.</span>
acid by distilling in a retort Cyprus vitriol, alum, and
saltpetre. He sets forth its corrosive power, and
shows how it may be made to dissolve even
gold itself, by adding a portion of sal ammoniac.
Djafar may thus be considered as having solved the grand
alchemical problem of obtaining gold in a potable state.
Of course, many trials must have been made on the influence
of this solution on the animal system, respecting
which such extravagant anticipations had been entertained.
The disappointment that ensued was doubtless the reason
that the records of these trials have not descended to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhazes discovers sulphuric acid.<br /><br />
Bechil discovers phosphorus.</div>

<p>With Djafar may be mentioned Rhazes, born <span class="smcap">A.D</span>. 860,
physician-in-chief to the great hospital at Bagdad.
To him is due the first description of the
preparation and properties of sulphuric acid.
He obtained it, as the Nordhausen variety is still made, by
the distillation of dried green vitriol. To him are also
due the first indications of the preparation of absolute
alcohol, by distilling spirit of wine from quick-lime. As
a curious discovery made by the Saracens may
be mentioned the experiment of Achild Bechil,
who, by distilling together the extract of urine,
clay, lime, and powdered charcoal, obtained an artificial
carbuncle, which shone in the dark "like a good moon."
This was phosphorus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geological views of Avicenna.</div>

<p>And now there arose among Arabian physicians a
correctness of thought and breadth of view altogether
surprising. It might almost be supposed that the following
lines were written by one of our own contemporaries;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
they are, however, extracted from a chapter of Avicenna
on the origin of mountains. This author was
born in the tenth century. "Mountains may
be due to two different causes. Either they are
effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth, such as
might occur during a violent earthquake, or they are the
effect of water, which, cutting for itself a new route, has
denuded the valleys, the strata being of different kinds,
some soft, some hard. The winds and waters disintegrate
the one, but leave the other intact. Most of the eminences
of the earth have had this latter origin. It would require
a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished,
during which the mountains themselves might be
somewhat diminished in size. But that water has been
the main cause of these effects is proved by the existence
of fossil remains of aquatic and other animals on many
mountains." Avicenna also explains the nature of petrifying
or incrusting waters, and mentions ærolites, out of
one of which a sword-blade was made, but he adds that
the metal was too brittle to be of any use. A mere catalogue
<span class="sidenote">His works indicate the attainment of the times.</span>
of some of the works of Avicenna will indicate the
condition of Arabian attainment. 1. On the
Utility and Advantage of Science; 2. Of Health
and Remedies; 3. Canons of Physic; 4. On
Astronomical Observations; 5. Mathematical
Theorems; 6. On the Arabic Language and its Properties;
7. On the Origin of the Soul and Resurrection of the
Body; 8. Demonstration of Collateral Lines on the
Sphere; 9. An Abridgment of Euclid; 10. On Finity
and Infinity; 11. On Physics and Metaphysics; 12. An
Encyclopædia of Human Knowledge, in 20 vols., etc., etc.
The perusal of such a catalogue is sufficient to excite
profound attention when we remember the contemporaneous
state of Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of the search for the elixir on practical medicine.</div>

<p>The pursuit of the elixir made a well-marked impression
upon Arab experimental science, confirming
it in its medical application. At the foundation
of this application lay the principle that
it is possible to relieve the diseases of the human
body by purely material means. As the science advanced
it gradually shook off its fetichisms, the spiritual receding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
into insignificance, the material coming into bolder relief.
Not, however, without great difficulty was a way forced
for the great doctrine that the influence of substances on
the constitution of man is altogether of a material kind,
and not at all due to any indwelling or animating spirit;
that it is of no kind of use to practise incantations over
drugs, or to repeat prayers over the mortar in which
medicines are being compounded, since the effect will be
the same, whether this has been done or not; that there
is no kind of efficacy in amulets, no virtue in charms; and
that, though saint-relics may serve to excite the imagination
of the ignorant, they are altogether beneath the
attention of the philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical conflict between Europe and Africa.</div>

<p>It was this last sentiment which brought Europe and
Africa into intellectual collision. The Saracen
and Hebrew physicians had become thoroughly
materialized. Throughout Christendom the
practice of medicine was altogether supernatural.
It was in the hands of ecclesiastics; and saint relics,
shrines, and miracle-cures were a source of boundless
profit. On a subsequent page I shall have to describe the
circumstances of the conflict that ensued between material
philosophy on one side, and supernatural jugglery on the
other; to show how the Arab system gained the victory,
and how, out of that victory, the industrial life of Europe
arose. The Byzantine policy inaugurated in Constantinople
and Alexandria was, happily for the world, in the
end overthrown. To that future page I must postpone
the great achievements of the Arabians in the fulness of
their Age of Reason. When Europe was hardly more
enlightened than Caffraria is now, the Saracens were
cultivating and even creating science. Their triumphs in
philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, medicine,
proved to be more glorious, more durable, and therefore
more important than their military actions had been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the Arabians.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Arabian influence, allying itself to philosophy, was
henceforth productive of other than military results. To
the loss of Africa and Asia was now added a disturbance
impressed on Europe itself, ending in the decomposition
of Christianity into two forms, Greek
and Latin, and in three great political events&mdash;the emancipation
of the popes from the emperors of Constantinople,
the usurpation of power by a new dynasty in France, the
reconstruction of the Roman empire in the West.</p>

<p>The dispute respecting the worship of images led to
those great events. The acts of the Mohammedan khalifs
and of the iconoclastic or image-breaking emperors occasioned
that dispute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship of relics and images.</div>

<p>Nothing could be more deplorable than the condition of
southern Europe when it first felt the intellectual influence
of the Arabians. Its old Roman and Greek populations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
had altogether disappeared; the races of half-breeds and
mongrels substituted for them were immersed
in fetichism. An observance of certain ceremonials
constituted a religious life. A chip of
the true cross, some iron filings from the chain of St. Peter,
a tooth or bone of a martyr, were held in adoration; the
world was full of the stupendous miracles which these
relics had performed. But especially were painted or
graven images of holy personages supposed to be endowed
with such powers. They had become objects of actual
worship. The facility with which the Empress Helena,
the mother of Constantine the Great, had given an aristocratic
fashion to this idolatry, showed that the old pagan
ideas had never really died out, and that the degenerated
populations received with approval the religious conceptions
of their great predecessors. The early Christian
fathers believed that painting and sculpture were forbidden
by the Scriptures, and that they were therefore wicked
arts; and, though the second Council of Nicea asserted
that the use of images had always been adopted by the
Church, there are abundant facts to prove that the actual
worship of them was not indulged in until the fourth
century, when, on the occasion of its occurrence in Spain,
it was condemned by the Council of Illiberis. During
the fifth century the practice of introducing images into
<span class="sidenote">Its rapid spread in Christendom.</span>
churches increased, and in the sixth it had become prevalent.
The common people, who had never been able
to comprehend doctrinal mysteries, found their
religious wants satisfied in turning to these
effigies. With singular obtuseness, they believed that the
saint is present in his image, though hundreds of the same
kind were in existence, each having an equal and exclusive
right to the spiritual presence. The doctrine of invocation
of departed saints, which assumed prominence in the
fifth century, was greatly strengthened by these graphic
forms. Pagan idolatry had reappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simple fetiches replaced by images.</div>

<p>At first the simple cross was used as a substitute for the
amulets and charms of remoter times; it constituted a
fetich able to expel evil spirits, even Satan himself. This
Being, who had become singularly debased from what
he was in the noble Oriental fictions, was an imbecile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and malicious though not a malignant spirit, affrighted
not only at pieces of wood framed in the shape of a cross,
but at the form of it made by the finger in the air. A
subordinate dæmon was supposed to possess
every individual at his birth, but he was cast
out by baptism. When, in the course of time,
the cross became a crucifix, offering a representation of
the dying Redeemer, it might be supposed to have gathered
increased virtue; and soon, in addition to that adorable
form, were introduced images of the Virgin, the apostles,
saints, and martyrs. The ancient times seemed to have
come again, when these pictures were approached with
genuflexions, luminaries, and incense. The doctrine of
the more intelligent was that these were aids to devotion,
and that, among people to whom the art of reading was
unknown, they served the useful purpose of recalling
<span class="sidenote">Bleeding and winking images.</span>
sacred events in a kind of hieroglyphic manner. But
among the vulgar, and monks, and women, they were
believed to be endowed with supernatural power.
Of some, the wounds could bleed; of others,
the eyes could wink; of others, the limbs could
be raised. In ancient times, the statues of Minerva could
brandish spears, and those of Venus could weep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Idolatry never extinguished in Greece and Italy.</div>

<p>In truth, the populations of the Greek and Latin
countries were no more than nominally converted and
superficially Christianized. The old traditions
and practices had never been forgotten. A
tendency to idolatry seemed to be the necessary
incident of the climate. Not without reason
have the apologists of the clergy affirmed that image-worship
was insisted on by the people, and that the
Church had to admit ideas that she had never been able
to eradicate. After seven hundred years of apostolic
labour, it was found that the populace of Greece and Italy
were apparently in their old state, and that actually
nothing at all had been accomplished; the new-comers
had passed into the track of their predecessors. It is
often said that the restoration of image-worship was
owing to the extinction of civilization by the Northern
barbarians. But this is not true. In the blood of the
German nations the taint of idolatry is but small. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
their own countries they gave it little encouragement,
and, indeed, hastened quickly to its total rejection. The
sin lay not with them, but with the Mediterranean
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of the barbarians.</div>

<p>Nor are those barbarians to be held accountable for the
so-called extinction of civilization in Italy. The true
Roman race had prematurely died; it came to an untimely
end in consequence of its dissolute, its violent life.
Its civilization would have spontaneously died
with it had no barbarian been present; and, if
these intruders produced a baneful effect at first, they
compensated for it in the end. As, when fresh coal is
added to a fire that is burning low, a still further diminution
will ensue, perhaps there may be a risk of entirely
putting it out; but in due season, if all goes well, the new
material will join in the contagious blaze. The savages
of Europe, thrown into the decaying foci of Greek and
Roman light, did perhaps for a time reduce the general
heat; but, by degrees, it spread throughout their mass,
and the bright flame of modern civilization was the
result. Let those who lament the intrusion of these men
into the classical countries, reflect upon the result which
must otherwise have ensued&mdash;the last spark would soon
have died out, and nothing but ashes have remained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of Iconoclasm.</div>

<p>Three causes gave rise to Iconoclasm, or the revolt
against image-worship: 1st, the remonstrances
and derision of the Mohammedans; 2nd, the
good sense of a great sovereign, Leo the Isaurian, who
had risen by his merit from obscurity, and had become the
founder of a new dynasty at Constantinople; 3rd, the
detected inability of these miracle-working idols and
fetiches to protect their worshippers or themselves against
an unbelieving enemy. Moreover, an impression was
gradually making its way among the more intelligent
classes that religion ought to free itself from such superstitions.
So important were the consequences of Leo's
actions, that some have been disposed to assign to his reign
the first attempt at making policy depend on theology;
and to this period, as I have elsewhere remarked, they
therefore refer the commencement of the Byzantine empire.
Through one hundred and twenty years, six emperors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
devoted themselves to this reformation. But it was
premature. They were overpowered by the populace and
the monks, by the bishops of Rome, and by a superstitious
and wicked woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inutility of miraculous images discovered in the
Arab invasions.<br /><br /><br />
Destruction and sale of idols by the Arabs.</div>

<p>It had been a favourite argument against the pagans
how little their gods could do for them when the hour of
calamity came, when their statues and images were insulted
and destroyed, and hence how vain was such
worship, how imbecile such gods. When Africa
and Asia, full of relics and crosses, pictures and
images, fell before the Mohammedans, those
conquerors retaliated the same logic with no
little effect. There was hardly one of the fallen towns
that had not some idol for its protector. Remembering
the stern objurgations of the prophet against this deadly
sin, prohibited at once by the commandment of God and
repudiated by the reason of man, the Saracen khalifs had
ordered all the Syrian images to be destroyed.
Amid the derision of the Arab soldiery and the
tears of the terror-stricken worshippers, these
orders were remorselessly carried into effect, except
in some cases where the temptation of an enormous ransom
induced the avengers of the unity of God to swerve from
their duty. Thus the piece of linen cloth on which it was
feigned that our Saviour had impressed his countenance,
and which was the palladium of Edessa, was carried off
by the victors at the capture of that town, and subsequently
sold to Constantinople at the profitable price of twelve
thousand pounds of silver. This picture, and also some
other celebrated ones, it was said, possessed the property
of multiplying themselves by contact with other surfaces,
as in modern times we multiply photographs. Such were
the celebrated images "made without hands."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Emperor prohibits image-worship.</div>

<p>It was currently asserted that the immediate origin of
Iconoclasm was due to the Khalif Yezed, who had completed
the destruction of the Syrian images, and to two
Jews, who stimulated Leo the Isaurian to his task. However
that may be, Leo published an edict, <small>A.D.</small>
726, prohibiting the worship of images. This
was followed by another directing their destruction,
and the whitewashing of the walls of churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
ornamented with them. Hereupon the clergy and the
monks rebelled; the emperor was denounced as a Mohammedan
and a Jew. He ordered that a statue of the
Saviour in that part of the city called Chalcopratia should
be removed, and a riot was the consequence. One of his
officers mounted a ladder and struck the idol with an axe
upon its face; it was an incident like that enacted centuries
before in the temple of Serapis at Alexandria. The
sacred image, which had often arrested the course of
Nature and worked many miracles, was now found to be
unable to protect or to avenge its own honour. A rabble
of women interfered in its behalf; they threw down the
<span class="sidenote">The monks sustain it.</span>
ladder and killed the officer; nor was the riot ended until
the troops were called in and a great massacre perpetrated.
The monks spread the sedition in all parts of
the empire; they even attempted to proclaim a
new emperor. Leo was everywhere denounced as a Mohammedan
infidel, an enemy of the Mother of God; but with
inflexible resolution he persisted in his determination as
long as he lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They accuse the emperor of atheism.</div>

<p>His son and successor, Constantine, pursued the same
iconoclastic policy. From the circumstance of his accidentally
defiling the font at which he was being baptized,
he had received the suggestive name of Copronymus.
His subsequent career was asserted by the monks to have
been foreshadowed by his sacrilegious beginnings. It was
publicly asserted that he was an atheist. In
truth, his biography, in many respects, proves
that the higher classes in Constantinople were
largely infected with infidelity. The patriarch deposed
upon oath that Copronymus had made the most irreligious
confessions to him, as that our Saviour, far from being the
Son of God, was, in his opinion, a mere man, born of his
mother in the common way. The truth of these accusations
was perhaps, in a measure, sustained by the revenge
that the emperor took on the patriarch for his indiscreet
revelations. He seized him, put out his eyes, caused him
to be led through the city mounted on an ass, with his
face to the tail, and then, as if to show his unutterable
contempt for all religion, with an exquisite malice, appointed
him to his office again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of Constantinople prohibits image-worship.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
If such was the religious condition of the emperor, the
higher clergy were but little better. A council was
summoned by Constantine, <small>A.D.</small> 754, at Constantinople,
which was attended by 388 bishops. It asserted
for itself the position of the seventh general
council. It unanimously decreed that all visible
symbols of Christ, except in the Eucharist, are
blasphemous or heretical; that image-worship is a corruption
of Christianity and a renewed form of paganism; it
directed all statues and paintings to be removed from the
churches and destroyed, it degraded every ecclesiastic and
excommunicated every layman who should be concerned
in setting them up again. It concluded its labours with
prayers for the emperor who had extirpated idolatry and
given peace to the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uproar among the monks.<br /><br />
The emperor retaliates.</div>

<p>But this decision was by no means quietly received.
The monks rose in an uproar; some raised a
clamour in their caves, some from the tops of their
pillars; one, in the church of St. Mammas,
insulted the emperor to his face, denouncing him as a
second apostate Julian. Nor could he deliver himself
from them by the scourging, strangling, and drowning of
individuals. In his wrath, Copronymus, plainly discerning
that it was the monks on one side and the government
on the other, determined to strike at the root of the evil,
and to destroy monasticism itself. He drove the
holy men out of their cells and cloisters; made
the consecrated virgins marry; gave up the buildings for
civil uses; burnt pictures, idols, and all kinds of relics;
degraded the patriarch from his office, scourged him, shaved
off his eyebrows, set him for public derision in the circus
in a sleeveless shirt, and then beheaded him. Already he
had consecrated a eunuch in his stead. Doubtless these
atrocities strengthened the bishops of Rome in their resolve
to seek a protector from such a master among the barbarian
kings of the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Re-establishment of image-worship by Irene the murderess.</div>

<p>Constantine Copronymus was succeeded by his son, Leo
the Chazar, who, during a short reign of five
years, continued the iconoclastic policy. On his
death his wife Irene seized the government,
ostensibly in behalf of her son. This woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
pre-eminently wicked and superstitious beyond her times,
undertook the restoration of images. She caused the
patriarch to retire from his dignity, appointed one of her
creatures, Tarasius, in his stead, and summoned another
council. In this second Council of Nicea that of Constantinople
was denounced as a synod of fools and atheists, the
worship of images was pronounced agreeable to Scripture
and reason, and in conformity to the usages and traditions
of the Church.</p>

<p>Irene, saluted as the second Helena, and set forth by
the monks as an exemplar of piety, thus accomplished the
restoration of image-worship. In a few years this ambitious
woman, refusing to surrender his rightful dignity to her
son, caused him to be seized, and, in the porphyry chamber
in which she had borne him, put out his eyes. Constantinople,
long familiar with horrible crimes, was appalled at
such an unnatural deed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resumption of Iconoclasm by the succeeding emperors.</div>

<p>During the succeeding reigns to that of Leo the Armenian,
matters remained without change; but that
emperor resumed the policy of Leo the Isaurian.
By an edict he prohibited image-worship, and
banished the Patriarch of Constantinople, who
had admonished him that the apostles had made images of
the Saviour and the Virgin, and that there was at Rome a
picture of the Transfiguration, painted by order of St.
Peter. After the murder of Leo, his successor, Michael
the Stammerer, showed no encouragement to either party.
It was affirmed that he was given to profane jesting, was
incredulous as to the resurrection of the dead, disbelieved
the existence of the devil, was indifferent whether images
were worshipped or not, and recommended the patriarch to
bury the decrees of Constantinople and Nicea equally in
<span class="sidenote">Their Saracenic tastes.</span>
oblivion. His successor and son, however, observed no
such impartiality. To Saracenic tastes, shown
by his building a palace like that of the khalif;
to a devotion for poetry, exemplified by branding some of
his own stanzas on his image-worshipping enemies; to the
composition of music and its singing by himself as an
amateur in the choir; to mechanical knowledge, displayed
by hydraulic contrivances, musical instruments, organs,
automatic singing-birds sitting in golden trees, he added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
an abomination of monks and a determined iconoclasm.
Instead of merely whitewashing the walls of the churches,
he adorned them with pictures of beasts and birds. Iconoclasm
had now become a struggle between the emperors
and the monks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final restoration of image-worship by the Empress Theodora.</div>

<p>Again, on the death of Theophilus, image-worship
triumphed, and triumphed in the same manner
as before. His widow, Theodora, alarmed by
the monks for the safety of the soul of her
husband, purchased absolution for him at the
price of the restoration of images.</p>

<p>Such was the issue of Iconoclasm in the East. The
monks proved stronger than the emperors, and, after a
struggle of 120 years, the images were finally restored.
In the West far more important consequences followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Image-worship in the West.</div>

<p>To image-worship Italy was devoutly attached. When
the first edict of Leo was made known by the
exarch, it produced a rebellion, of which Pope
Gregory II. took advantage to suspend the
tribute paid by Italy. In letters that he wrote to the
emperor he defended the popular delusion, declaring that
the first Christians had caused pictures to be made of our
Lord, of his brother James, of Stephen, and all the martyrs,
and had sent them throughout the world; the reason that
God the Father had not been painted was that his countenance
was not known. These letters display a most
<span class="sidenote">It is sustained by the pope,</span>
audacious presumption of the ignorance of the emperor
respecting common Scripture incidents, and, as
some have remarked, suggest a doubt of the
pope's familiarity with the sacred volume. He
points out the difference between the statues of antiquity,
which are only the representations of phantoms, and the
images of the Church, which have approved themselves,
by numberless miracles, to be the genuine forms of the
Saviour, his mother, and his saints. Referring to the
statue of St. Peter, which the emperor had ordered to be
broken to pieces, he declares that the Western nations
regard that apostle as a god upon earth, and ominously
threatens the vengeance of the pious barbarians if it should
be destroyed. In this defence of images Gregory found
an active coadjutor in a Syrian, John of Damascus, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
had witnessed the rage of the khalifs against the images
of his own country, and whose hand, having been cut off
by those tyrants, had been miraculously rejoined to his
body by an idol of the Virgin to which he prayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and by the Lombard king.</div>

<p>But Gregory was not alone in his policy, nor John of
Damascus in his controversies. The King of the
Lombards, Luitprand, also perceived the advantage
of putting himself forth as the protector of
images, and of appealing to the Italians, for their sake, to
expel the Greeks from the country. The pope acted on
the principle that heresy in a sovereign justifies withdrawal
of allegiance, the Lombard that it excuses the
seizure of possessions. Luitprand accordingly ventured
on the capture of Ravenna. An immense booty, the
accumulation of the emperors, the Gothic kings, and the
exarchs, which was taken at the storming of the town, at
once rewarded his piety, stimulated him to new enterprises
of a like nature, and drew upon him the attention of his
enemy the emperor, whom he had plundered, and of his
confederate the pope, whom he had overreached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of affairs at this time.</div>

<p>This was the position of affairs. If the Lombards, who
were Arians, and therefore heretics, should succeed in
extending their sway all over Italy, the influence
and prosperity of the papacy must come to an
end; their action on the question of the images
was altogether of an ephemeral and delusive kind, for all
the northern nations preferred a simple worship like that of
primitive times, and had never shown any attachment to
the adoration of graven forms. If, on the other hand, the
pope should continue his allegiance to Constantinople, he
must be liable to the atrocious persecutions so often and so
recently inflicted on the patriarchs of that city by their
tyrannical master; and the breaking of that connexion in
reality involved no surrender of any solid advantages, for
<span class="sidenote">The Saracens dominate in the Mediterranean.</span>
the emperor was too weak to give protection from the
Lombards. Already had been experienced a portentous
difficulty in sending relief from Constantinople,
on account of the naval superiority of the
Saracens in the Mediterranean. For the taxes
paid to the sovereign no real equivalent was
received; but Rome, in ignominy, was obliged to submit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
like an obscure provincial town, to the mandates of the
Eastern court. Moreover, in her eyes, the emperor, by
reason of his iconoclasm, was a heretic. But if alliance
with the Lombards and allegiance to the Greeks were
<span class="sidenote">Causes of the alliance of the popes and the Franks.</span>
equally inexpedient, a third course was possible. A mayor
of the palace of the Frankish kings had successfully
led his armies against the Arabs from
Spain, and had gained the great victory of
Tours. If the Franks, under the influence
of their climate or the genius of their race, had thus far
shown no encouragement to images, in all other respects
they were orthodox, for they had been converted by
Catholic missionaries; their kings, it was true, were mere
phantoms, but Charles Martel had proved himself a great
soldier; he was, therefore, an ambitious man. There was
Scripture authority for raising a subordinate to sovereign
power; the prophets of Israel had thus, of old, with oil
anointed kings. And if the sword of France was gently
removed from the kingly hand that was too weak to hold
it, and given to the hero who had already shown that he
could smite terribly with it&mdash;if this were done by the
authority of the pope, acting as the representative of God,
how great the gain to the papacy! A thousand years
might not be enough to separate the monarchy of France
from the theocracy of Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolt of the pope from the emperor.</div>

<p>The resistance which had sprung up to the imperial
edict for the destruction of images determined the course
of events. The pope rebelled, and attempts were made by
the emperor to seize or assassinate him. A fear
that the pontiff might be carried to Constantinople,
and the preparations making to destroy
the images in the churches, united all Italy. A council
was held at Rome, which anathematized the Iconoclasts.
In retaliation, the Sicilian and other estates of the Church
were confiscated. Gregory III., who in the meantime
succeeded to the papacy, continued the policy of his predecessor.
The emperor was defied. A fleet, fitted out by
him in support of the exarch, was lost in a storm. With
this termination of the influence of Constantinople in Italy
came the imminent danger that the pope must acknowledge
the supremacy of the Lombards. In his distress Gregory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Alliance of the pope and the Franks.</span>
turned to Charles Martel. He sent him the keys of the
sepulchre of St. Peter, and implored his assistance.
The die was cast. Papal Rome revolted
from her sovereign, and became indissolubly
bound to the barbarian kingdoms. To France a new
dynasty was given, to the pope temporal power, and to the
west of Europe a fictitious Roman empire.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">The monks.</div>

<p>The monks had thus overcome the image-breaking
emperors, a result which proves them to have
already become a formidable power in the state.
It is necessary, for a proper understanding of the great
events with which henceforth they were connected, to
describe their origin and history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their first position</div>

<p>In the iconoclastic quarrel they are to be regarded as
the representatives of the common people in contradistinction
to the clergy; often, indeed, the representatives of
the populace, infected with all its instincts of superstition
and fanaticism. They are the upholders of miracle-cures,
invocation of saints, worship of images, clamorous
asserters of a unity of faith in the Church&mdash;a
unity which they never practised, but which offered a
convenient pretext for a bitter persecution of heresy and
paganism, though they were more than half pagan themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and subsequent improvement.</div>

<p>It was their destiny to impress on the practical life of
Europe that mixture of Christianity and heathenism
engendered by political events in Italy and
Greece. Yet, while they thus co-operated in
great affairs, they themselves exhibited, in the
most signal manner, the force of that law of continuous
variation of opinion and habits to which all enduring
communities of men must submit. Born of superstition,
obscene in their early life, they end in luxury, refinement,
learning. Theirs is a history to which we may profitably
attend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first hermits.</div>

<p>From very early times there had been in India zealots
who, actuated by a desire of removing themselves
from the temptations of society and preparing
for another life, retired into solitary places. Such
also were the Essenes among the Jews, and the Therapeutæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
in Egypt. Pliny speaks of the blameless life of the former
when he says, "They are the companions of palms;"
nor does he hide his astonishment at an immortal society
in which no one is ever born. Their example was not
lost upon more devout Christians, particularly after the
influence of Magianism began to be felt. Though it is
sometimes said that the first of these hermits were Anthony
and Paulus, they doubtless are to be regarded as only
having rendered themselves more illustrious by their
superior sanctity among a crowd of worthies who had
preceded them or were their contemporaries. As early as
the second and third centuries the practice of retirement
had commenced among Christians; soon afterwards it had
become common. The date of Hilarion is about <small>A.D.</small> 328,
of Basil <small>A.D.</small> 360. Regarding prayer as the only occupation
in which man may profitably engage, they gave no
<span class="sidenote">Their self-denial.</span>
more attention to the body than the wants of nature
absolutely demanded. A little dried fruit or bread for
food, and water for drink, were sufficient for its
support; occasionally a particle of salt might be
added, but the use of warm water was looked upon as
betraying a tendency to luxury. The incentives to many
of their rules of life might excite a smile, if it were right
to smile at the acts of earnest men. Some, like the innocent
Essenes, who would do nothing whatever on the
Sabbath, observed the day before as a fast, rigorously
abstaining from food and drink, that nature might not
force them into sin on the morrow. For some, it was not
enough, by the passive means of abstinence, to refrain from
fault or reduce the body to subjection, though starvation
is the antidote for desire; the more active, and, perhaps,
more effectual operation of periodical flagellations and
bodily torture were added. Ingenuity was taxed to
find new means of personal infliction. A hermit who
never permitted himself to sleep more than an hour
without being awakened endured torments not inferior to
those of the modern fakir, who crosses his arms on the top
of his head and keeps them there for years, until they are
wasted to the bone, or suspends himself to a pole by means
of a hook inserted in the flesh of his back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Profound contemplation of God.<br /><br />
Aerial martyrs. Holy birds.</div>

<p>Among the Oriental sects there are some who believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
that the Supreme Being is perpetually occupied in the contemplation
of himself, and that the nearer man
can approach to a state of total inaction the more
will he resemble God. For many years the
Indian sage never raises his eyes from his navel; absorbed
in the profound contemplation of it, his perennial reverie
is unbroken by any outward suggestions, the admiring
by-standers administering, as chance offers, the little food
and water that his wants require. Under the
influence of such ideas, in the fifth century, St.
Simeon Stylites, who in his youth had often
been saved from suicide, by ascending a column he had
built, sixty feet in height, and only one foot square at the
top, departed as far as he could from earthly affairs, and
approached more closely to heaven. On this elevated
retreat, to which he was fastened by a chain, he endured,
if we may believe the incredible story, for thirty years the
summer's sun and the winter's frost. Afar off the passer-by
was edified by seeing the motionless figure of the holy man
with outstretched arms like a cross, projected against the
sky, in his favourite attitude of prayer, or expressing his
thankfulness for the many mercies of which he supposed
himself to be the recipient by rapidly striking his forehead
against his knees. Historians relate that a curious spectator
counted twelve hundred and forty-four of these
motions, and then abstained through fatigue from any
farther tally, though the unwearied exhibition was still
going on. This "most holy aerial martyr," as Evagrius
calls him, attained at last his reward, and Mount Telenissa
witnessed a vast procession of devout admirers accompanying
to the grave his mortal remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The monks insist on celibacy.</div>

<p>More commonly, however, the hermit declined the conspicuous
notoriety of these "holy birds," as they were called
by the profane, and, retiring to some cave in the desert,
despised the comforts of life, and gave himself up to
penance and prayer. Among men who had thus altogether
exalted themselves above the wants of the flesh, there was
no toleration for its lusts. The sinfulness of the
marriage relation, and the pre-eminent value of
chastity, followed from their principles. If it
was objected to such practices that by their universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
adoption the human species would soon be extinguished,
and no man would remain to offer praises to God, these
zealots, remembering the temptations from which they had
escaped, with truth replied that there would always be
sinners enough in the world to avoid that disaster, and
that out of their evil works good would be brought. St.
Jerome offers us the pregnant reflection that, though it
may be marriage that fills the earth, it is virginity that
replenishes heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grazing hermits.</div>

<p>If they were not recorded by many truthful authors, the
extravagances of some of these enthusiasts would pass
belief. Men and women ran naked upon all fours, associating
themselves with the beasts of the field. In
the spring season, when the grass is tender, the
grazing hermits of Mesopotamia went forth to the plains,
sharing with the cattle their filth, and their food. Of some,
notwithstanding a weight of evidence, the stupendous
biography must tax their admirers' credulity. It is affirmed
that St. Ammon had never seen his own body uncovered;
that an angel carried him on his back over a river which
he was obliged to cross; that at his death he ascended to
heaven through the skies, St. Anthony being an eye-witness
of the event&mdash;St. Anthony, who was guided to the hermit
Paulus by a centaur; that Didymus never spoke to a
human being for ninety years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insane hermits.</div>

<p>From the Jewish anchorites, who of old sought a retreat
beneath the shade of the palms of Engaddi, who beguiled
their weary hours in the chanting of psalms by the bitter
waters of the Dead Sea; from the philosophic Hindu, who
sought for happiness in bodily inaction and mental exercise,
to these Christian solitaries, the stages of delusion
are numerous and successive. It would not
be difficult to present examples of each step in the career
of debasement. To one who is acquainted with the working
and accidents of the human brain, it will not be
surprizing that an asylum for hermits who had become
hopelessly insane was instituted at Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of hallucinations.</div>

<p>The biographies of these recluses, for ages a source of consolation
to the faithful in their temptations, are not to be
regarded as mere works of fiction, though they abound in
supernatural occurrences, and are the forerunners of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
dæmonology of the Middle Ages. The whole world was a
scene of dæmoniac adventures, of miracles and wonders. So
far from being mere impostures, they relate nothing more
than may be witnessed at any time under similar
conditions. In the brain of man, impressions of
whatever he has seen or heard, of whatever has been made
manifest to him by his other senses, nay, even the vestiges
of his former thoughts, are stored up. These traces are
most vivid at first, but, by degrees, they decline in force,
though they probably never completely die out. During
our waking hours, while we are perpetually receiving
new impressions from things that surround us, such
vestiges are overpowered, and cannot attract the attention
of the mind. But in the period of sleep, when external
influences cease, they present themselves to our regard, and
the mind submitting to the delusion, groups them into
the fantastic forms of dreams. By the use of opium and
other drugs which can blunt our sensibility to passing
events, these phantasms may be made to emerge. They
also offer themselves in the delirium of fevers and in the
hour of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supernatural appearances.</div>

<p>It is immaterial in what manner or by what agency our
susceptibility to the impressions of surrounding objects is
benumbed, whether by drugs, or sleep, or disease,
as soon as their force is no greater than that of
forms already registered in the brain, those forms will
emerge before us, and dreams or apparitions are the result.
So liable is the mind to practise deception on itself, that
with the utmost difficulty it is aware of the delusion. No
man can submit to long-continued and rigorous fasting
without becoming the subject of these hallucinations; and
the more he enfeebles his organs of sense, the more vivid
is the exhibition, the more profound the deception. An
ominous sentence may perhaps be incessantly whispered in
his ear; to his fixed and fascinated eye some grotesque or
abominable object may perpetually present itself. To the
hermit, in the solitude of his cell, there doubtless often did
appear, by the uncertain light of his lamp, obscene shadows
of diabolical import; doubtless there was many an agony
with fiends, many a struggle with monsters, satyrs, and
imps, many an earnest, solemn, and manful controversy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
with Satan himself, who sometimes came as an aged man,
sometimes with a countenance of horrible intelligence, and
sometimes as a female fearfully beautiful. St. Jerome, who,
with the utmost difficulty, had succeeded in extinguishing
all carnal desires, ingenuously confesses how sorely he was
tried by this last device of the enemy, how nearly the
ancient flames were rekindled. As to the reality of these
apparitions, why should a hermit be led to suspect that
they arose from the natural working of his own brain?
Men never dream that they are dreaming. To him they
were terrible realities; to us they should be the proofs of
insanity, not of imposture.</p>

<p>If, in the prison discipline of modern times, it has been
found that solitary confinement is a punishment too
dreadful for the most hardened convict to bear, and that,
if persisted in, it is liable to lead to insanity, how much
more quickly must that unfortunate condition have been
induced when the trials of religious distress and the
physical enfeeblement arising from rigorous fastings and
incessant watchings were added? To the dreadful ennui
which precedes that state, one of the ancient monks
pathetically alludes when he relates how often he went
forth and returned to his cell, and gazed on the sun as if
he hastened too slowly to his setting. And yet such fearful
solitude is of but brief duration. Even though we flee
<span class="sidenote">Delusions created by the mind.</span>
to the desert we cannot be long alone. Cut off from social
converse, the mind of man engenders companions
for itself&mdash;companions like the gloom from which
they have emerged. It was thus that to St.
Anthony appeared the Spirit of Fornication, under the
form of a lascivious negro boy; it was thus that multitudes
of dæmons of horrible aspect cruelly beat him nearly to
death, the brave old man defying them to the last, and
telling them that he did not wish to be spared one of their
blows; it was thus that in the night, with hideous
laughter, they burst into his cell, under the form of lions,
serpents, scorpions, asps, lizards, panthers, and wolves,
each attacking him in own way; thus that when, in
his dire extremity, he lifted his eyes for help, the roof disappeared,
and amid beams of light the Saviour looked
down; thus it was with the enchanted silver dish that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Satan gave him, which, being touched, vanished in smoke;
thus with the gigantic bats and centaurs, and the two lions
that helped him to scratch a grave for Paul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Important religious results of cerebral sight.</div>

<p>The images that may thus emerge from the brain have
been classed by physiologists among the phenomena of
inverse vision, or cerebral sight. Elsewhere I have given
a detailed investigation of their nature (Human Physiology,
chap, xxi.), and, persuaded that they have played a far
more important part in human affairs than is commonly
supposed, have thus expressed myself: "Men in every part
of the world, even among nations the most abject
and barbarous, have an abiding faith not only
in the existence of a spirit that animates us, but
also in its immortality. Of these there are
multitudes who have been shut out from all communion
with civilized countries, who have never been enlightened
by revelation, and who are mentally incapable of reasoning
out for themselves arguments in support of those great
truths. Under such circumstances, it is not very likely
that the uncertainties of tradition, derived from remote
ages, could be any guide to them, for traditions soon disappear
except they be connected with the wants of daily
life. Can there be, in a philosophical view, anything
more interesting than the manner in which these defects
have been provided for by implanting in the very organization
of every man the means of constantly admonishing him
of these facts&mdash;of recalling them with an unexpected vividness
before even after they have become so faint as almost to
die out? Let him be as debased and benighted a savage
as he may, shut out from all communion with races whom
Providence has placed in happier circumstances, he has
<span class="sidenote">A future world.</span>
still the same organization, and is liable to the same
physiological incidents, as ourselves. Like us, he sees in
his visions the fading forms of landscapes which
are perhaps connected with some of his most grateful
recollections, and what other conclusion can he possibly
derive from these unreal pictures than that they are the
foreshadowings of another land beyond that in which his
lot is cast. Like us, he is revisited at intervals by the

they were alive, nor can he ever be so brutalized as not to

<span class="sidenote">Immortality of the soul.</span>
discern in such manifestations suggestions which to him are
incontrovertible proofs of the existence and immortality
of the soul. Even in the most refined
social conditions we are never able to shake off the impressions
of these occurrences, and are perpetually drawing from
them the same conclusions that our uncivilized ancestors
did. Our more elevated condition of life in no respect
relieves us from the inevitable consequences of our own
organization, any more than it relieves us from infirmities
and disease. In these respects, all over the globe we are
on an equality. Savage or civilized, we carry within us a
mechanism intended to present to us mementoes of the
most solemn facts with which we can be concerned, and
the voice of history tells us that it has ever been true to
its design. It wants only moments of repose or sickness,
when the influence of external things is diminished, to
come into full play, and these are precisely the moments
when we are best prepared for the truths it is going to
suggest. Such a mechanism is in keeping with the manner
in which the course of nature is fulfilled, and bears in its
very style the impress of invariability of action. It is no
respecter of persons. It neither permits the haughtiest to
be free from its monitions, nor leaves the humblest without
the consolation of a knowledge of another life. Liable to
no mischances, open to no opportunities of being tampered
with by the designing or interested, requiring no extraneous
human agency for its effect, but always present with each
man wherever he may go, it marvellously extracts from
vestiges of the impressions of the past overwhelming proofs
of the reality of the future, and gathering its power from
what would seem to be a most unlikely source, it insensibly
leads us, no matter who or where we may be, to a
profound belief in the immortal and imperishable, from
phantoms that have scarcely made their appearance before
they are ready to vanish away."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amelioration of monasticism.</div>

<p>From such beginnings the monastic system of Europe
arose&mdash;that system which presents us with learning
in the place of ferocious ignorance, with overflowing
charity to mankind in the place of
malignant hatred of society. The portly abbot on his
easy going palfrey, his hawk upon his fist, scarce looks like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the lineal descendant of the hermit starved into insanity.
How wide the interval between the monk of the third and
the monk of the thirteenth century&mdash;between the caverns
of Thebais and majestic monasteries cherishing the relics of
ancient learning, the hopes of modern philosophy&mdash;between
the butler arranging his well-stocked larder, and the jug
<span class="sidenote">Its final corruptions.</span>
of cold water and crust of bread. A thousand years had
turned starvation into luxury, and alas! if the spoilers of
the Reformation are to be believed, had converted
visions of loveliness into breathing and
blushing realities, who exercised their charms with better
effect than of old their phantom sisters had done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The modifications of eremitism.</div>

<p>The successive stages to this end may be briefly described.
Around the cell of some eremite like Anthony,
who fixed his retreat on Mount Colzim, a number of
humble imitators gathered, emulous of his austerities and
of his piety. A similar sentiment impels them
to observe stated hours of prayer. Necessity for
supporting the body indicates some pursuit of
idle industry, the plaiting of mats or making of baskets.
So strong is the instinctive tendency of man to association,
that even communities of madmen may organize. Hilarion
is said to have been the first who established a monastic
community. He went into the desert when he was only
fifteen years old. Eremitism thus gave birth to C&oelig;nobitism,
and the evils of solitude were removed. Yet still
there remained rigorous anchorites who renounced their
associated brethren as these had renounced the world, and
the monastery was surrounded by their circle of solitary
cells&mdash;a Laura, it was called. In Egypt, the sandy deserts
on each side of the rich valley of the river offered great
facilities for such a mode of life: that of Nitria was full of
<span class="sidenote">Number of anchorites.</span>
monks, the climate being mild and the wants of man easily
satisfied. It is said that there were at one time
in that country of these religious recluses not
fewer than seventy-six thousand males and twenty-seven
thousand females. With countless other uncouth forms,
under the hot sun of that climate they seemed to be
spawned from the mud of the Nile. As soon as from some
celebrated hermitage a monastery had formed, the associates
submitted to the rules of brotherhood. Their meal, eaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in silence, consisted of bread and water, oil, and a little
salt. The bundle of papyrus which had served the monk
for a seat by day, while he made his baskets or mats,
served him for a pillow by night. Twice he was roused
from his sleep by the sound of a horn to offer up his
prayers. The culture of superstition was compelled by
inexorable rules. A discipline of penalties, confinement,
fasting, whipping, and, at a later period even mutilation,
was inflexibly administered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of monasticism from Egypt.</div>

<p>From Egypt and Syria monachism spread like an epidemic.
It was first introduced into Italy by
Athanasius, assisted by some of the disciples of
Anthony; but Jerome, whose abode was in
Palestine, is celebrated for the multitude of converts he
made to a life of retirement. Under his persuasion,
many of the high-born ladies of Rome were led to the
practice of monastic habits, as far as was possible, in
secluded spots near that city, on the ruins of temples, and
even in the Forum. Some were induced to retreat to the
Holy Land, after bestowing their wealth for pious purposes.
The silent monk insinuated himself into the privacy of
families for the purpose of making proselytes by stealth.
Soon there was not an unfrequented island in the Mediterranean,
no desert shore, no gloomy valley, no forest, no
glen, no volcanic crater, that did not witness exorbitant
selfishness made the rule of life. There were multitudes
of hermits on the desolate coasts of the Black Sea. They
abounded from the freezing Tanais to the sultry Tabenné.
In rigorous personal life and in supernatural power the
West acknowledged no inferiority to the East; his admiring
imitators challenged even the desert of Thebais to produce
the equal of Martin of Tours. The solitary anchorite was
soon supplanted by the c&oelig;nobitic establishment, the
monastery. It became a fashion among the rich to give
all that they had to these institutions for the salvation of
their own souls. There was now no need of basket-making
or the weaving of mats. The brotherhoods increased
rapidly. Whoever wanted to escape from the barbarian
invaders, or to avoid the hardships of serving in the
imperial army&mdash;whoever had become discontented with
his worldly affairs, or saw in those dark times no inducements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Increase of the religious houses.</span>
in a home and family of his own, found in the
monastery a sure retreat. The number of these
religious houses eventually became very great.
They were usually placed on the most charming
and advantageous sites, their solidity and splendour illustrating
the necessity of erecting durable habitations for
societies that were immortal. It often fell out that the
Church laid claim to the services of some distinguished
monk. It was significantly observed that the road to
ecclesiastical elevation lay through the monastery porch,
and often ambition contentedly wore for a season the cowl,
that it might seize more surely the mitre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference of the Eastern and Western monk.</div>

<p>Though the monastic system of the East included labour,
it was greatly inferior to that of the West in
that particular. The Oriental monk, at first
making selfishness his rule of life, and his own
salvation the grand object, though all the world
else should perish, in his maturer period occupied his intellectual
powers in refined disputations of theology. Too
often he exhibited his physical strength in the furious riots
he occasioned in the streets of the great cities. He was a
fanatic and insubordinate. On the other hand, the Occidental
monk showed far less disposition for engaging in
the discussion of things above reason, and expended his
strength in useful and honourable labour. Beneath his
hand the wilderness became a garden. To a considerable
extent this difference was due to physiological peculiarity,
and yet it must not be concealed that the circumstances of
life in the two cases were not without their effects. The old
countries of the East, with their worn-out civilization and
worn-out soil, offered no inducements comparable with the
barbarous but young and fertile West, where to the
ecclesiastic the most lovely and inviting lands were open.
Both, however, coincided in this, that they regarded the
affairs of life as presenting perpetual interpositions of a
providential or rather supernatural kind&mdash;angels and devils
being in continual conflict for the soul of every man, who
might become the happy prize of the one or the miserable
prey of the other. These spiritual powers were perpetually
controlling the course of nature and giving rise to prodigies.
The measure of holiness in a saint was the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Legends of Western saints.</span>
miracles he had worked. Thus, in the life of St. Benedict,
it is related that when his nurse Cyrilla let
fall a stone sieve, her distress was changed into
rejoicing by the prayer of the holy child, at
which the broken parts came together and were made
whole; that once on receiving his food in a basket, let
down to his otherwise inaccessible cell, the devil vainly
tried to vex him by breaking the rope; that once Satan,
assuming the form of a blackbird, nearly blinded him by
the flapping of his wings; that once, too, the same tempter
appeared as a beautiful Roman girl, to whose fascinations,
in his youth, St. Benedict had been sensible, and from
which he now hardly escaped by rolling himself among
thorns. Once, when his austere rules and severity excited
the resentment of the monastery over which he was abbot,
the brethren&mdash;for monks have been known to do such
things&mdash;attempted to poison him, but the cup burst
asunder as soon as he took it into his hands. When the
priest Florentius, being wickedly disposed, attempted to
perpetrate a like crime by means of an adulterated loaf,
a raven carried away the deadly bread from the hand of
St. Benedict. Instructed by the devil, the same Florentius
drove from his neighbourhood the holy man, by turning
into the garden of his monastery seven naked girls; but
scarcely had the saint taken to flight, when the chamber
in which his persecutor lived fell in and buried him
beneath its ruins, though the rest of the house was uninjured.
Under the guidance of two visible angels, who
walked before him, St. Benedict continued his journey to
Monte Casino, where he erected a noble monastery; but
even here miracles did not cease; for Satan bewitched the
stones, so that it was impossible for the masons to move
them until they were released by powerful prayers. A
boy, who had stolen from the monastery to visit his parents
was not only struck dead by God for his offence, but the
consecrated ground threw forth his body when they
attempted to bury it; nor could it be made to rest until
consecrated bread was laid upon it. Two garrulous nuns,
who had been excommunicated by St. Benedict for their
perverse prating, chanced to be buried in the church.
On the next administration of the sacrament, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
deacon commanded all those who did not communicate to
depart, the corpses rose out of their graves and walked
forth from the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The character of these miracles.</div>

<p>Volumes might be filled with such wonders, which edified
the religious for centuries, exacting implicit belief,
and being regarded as of equal authority with
the miracles of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Though monastic life rested upon the principle of social
abnegation, monasticism, in singular contradiction thereto,
contained within itself the principle of organization.
<span class="sidenote">Rise and progress of monastic orders.</span>
As early as <small>A.D.</small> 370, St. Basil, the Bishop
of Cæsarea, incorporated the hermits and c&oelig;nobites
of his diocese into one order, called after him the
Basilian. One hundred and fifty years later, St. Benedict,
under a milder rule, organised those who have passed
under his name, and found for them occupation in suitable
employments of manual and intellectual labour. In the
ninth century, another Benedict revised the rule of the
order, and made it more austere. Offshoots soon arose, as
those of Clugni, <small>A.D.</small> 900; the Carthusians, <small>A.D.</small> 1084; the
Cistercians, <small>A.D.</small> 1098. A favourite pursuit among them
being literary labour, they introduced great improvements
in the copying of manuscripts; and in their illumination
and illustration are found the germs of the restoration of
painting and the invention of cursive handwriting. St.
Benedict enjoined his order to collect books. It has been
happily observed that he forgot to say anything about
their character, supposing that they must all be religious.
The Augustinians were founded in the eleventh century.
They professed, however, to be a restoration of the society
founded ages before by St. Augustine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Benedictines.</div>

<p>The influence to which monasticism attained may be
judged of from the boast of the Benedictines
that "Pope John XXII., who died in 1334, after
an exact inquiry, found that, since the first rise of the
order, there had been of it 24 popes, near 200 cardinals,
7000 archbishops, 15,000 bishops, 15,000 abbots of renown,
above 4000 saints, and upward of 37,000 monasteries.
There have been likewise, of this order, 20 emperors and
10 empresses, 47 kings and above 50 queens, 20 sons of
emperors, and 48 sons of kings; about 100 princesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
daughters of kings and emperors; besides dukes, marquises,
earls, countesses, etc., innumerable. The order has produced
a vast number of authors and other learned men. Their
Rabanus set up the school of Germany. Their Alcuin
founded the University of Paris. Their Dionysius Exiguus
perfected ecclesiastical computation. Their Guido
invented the scale of music; their Sylvester, the organ.
They boasted to have produced Anselm, Ildefonsus, and the
Venerable Bede."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civilization of Europe by the monks.</div>

<p>We too often date the Christianization of a community
from the conversion of its sovereign, but it is not in the
nature of things that that should change the hearts of men.
Of what avail is it if a barbarian chieftain drives a horde
of his savages through the waters of a river by way of
extemporaneous or speedy baptism? Such outward forms
are of little moment. It was mainly by the
monasteries that to the peasant class of Europe
was pointed out the way of civilization. The
devotions and charities; the austerities of the brethren;
their abstemious meal; their meagre clothing, the cheapest
of the country in which they lived; their shaven heads, or
the cowl which shut out the sight of sinful objects; the
long staff in their hands; their naked feet and legs; their
passing forth on their journeys by twos, each a watch on
his brother; the prohibitions against eating outside of the
wall of the monastery, which had its own mill, its own
bakehouse, and whatever was needed in an abstemious
domestic economy; their silent hospitality to the wayfarer,
who was refreshed in a separate apartment; the lands
around their buildings turned from a wilderness into a
garden, and, above all, labour exalted and ennobled by
their holy hands, and celibacy, for ever, in the eye of the
vulgar, a proof of separation from the world and a sacrifice
to heaven&mdash;these were the things that arrested the attention
of the barbarians of Europe, and led them on to
civilization. In our own material age, the advocates of
the monastery have plaintively asked, Where now shall
we find an asylum for the sinner who is sick of the world&mdash;for
the man of contemplation in his old age, or for the
statesman who is tired of affairs? It was through the
leisure procured by their wealth that the monasteries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Their later intellectual influence.</span>
produced so many cultivators of letters, and transmitted to
us the literary relics of the old times. It was a fortunate
day when the monk turned from the weaving of
mats to the copying of manuscripts&mdash;a fortunate
day when he began to compose those noble
hymns and strains of music which will live for ever. From
the "Dies Iræ" there rings forth grand poetry even in
monkish Latin. The perpetual movements of the monastic
orders gave life to the Church. The Protestant admits
that to a resolute monk the Reformation was due.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their materialization of religion.</div>

<p>With these pre-eminent merits, the monastic institution
had its evils. Through it was spread that
dreadful materialization of religion which, for so
many ages, debased sacred things; through it
that worse than pagan apotheosis, which led to the adoration&mdash;for
such it really was&mdash;of dead men; through it were
sustained relics and lying miracles, a belief in falsehoods
so prodigious as to disgrace the common sense of man.
The apostles and martyrs of old were forgotten; nay, even
the worship of God was forsaken for shrines that could cure
all diseases, and relics that could raise the dead. Through
it was developed that intense selfishness which hesitated
at no sacrifice either of the present or the future, so far as
this life is concerned, in order to insure personal happiness
in the next&mdash;a selfishness which, in the delusion of the times,
passed under the name of piety; and the degree of abasement
from the dignity of a man was made the measure of
the merit of a monk.</p>
